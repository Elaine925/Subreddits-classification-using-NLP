the week be there be rain consistently be cart path only which make for some extra walk when play solo the green fee be quite high plus for club rental but for once lifetime opportunity be worth the westin princeville villa that be stay the hole when be near those hole call wife and she be able come and watch hit few hole and take some pics videos that be plus kiahuna golf course this be really close the sheraton kauai about minute drive good mountain course and harder than look lol definitely have more trouble here than makai green fee be cheaper than makai and for rental however the condition here weren well maintain lot burn areas the green divots weren repair tee box uneven this course be not kauai not sure would worth which be too bad the course itself and the view be nice

lot selections then watch cover band play without dance floor then be usher the hotel patio wait and watch the countdown and the fireworks this be stark difference the party that be happen the house without key garden nye party they have band go after dinner and nice dance floor while wait for the fireworks the crazy thing be pay more for the ballroom party than the house without key party should

beach the location be great be close nearly everything visit rental car kihei rent car have rent from them twice and they be very quick pick and get the road the car rent be older model nissan sentra which be perfect for what need frills but clean and feel well service be able drive see sunrise haleakal with the car complaints food recommendations island vintage coffee amaze coffees banana kona mocha our favorite acai bowl and shave ice thai mee food truck the lot near costco best thai food have ever paia fish market any location great can get crowd meal time but well worth the wait foodland poke fresh well price with lot difference choices activities our highest recommendation molokini crater snorkel tour amaze place snorkel water temperature surprisingly seem warmer than when visit the summer go with trilogy for the earliest morning slot be not very crowd and the tour be standard snack drink and lunch be provide condition do not allow turtle town divert olowalu and do see green sea turtle there farm tour farm table tour the slop haleakal be able see many different type plant many which be prepare the dish serve the end the tour the cost be little pricey but be glad do low cost and free activities our highest recommendation sunrise haleakal be cold rainy and foggy when go but still enjoy be the summit start get crowd around hour before sunrise but since be rainy most people stay their cars try come again next time iao valley beautiful and lush valley with nice trail walk along make sure make reservation waihe ridge trail few things compare see the view from the top for the first time not recommend list mama fish house this be our first time visit and be very excite that be able reserve spot for dinner the area very beautiful and the presentation the restaurant exactly what expect but the food itself be not our like especially for the price maybe more food truck people glad experience but would not again hawai big island days decide the big island between maui and ahu afterthought people keep tell that days with the days include flight be not enough and should have listen what amaze and expansive island stay airbnb kona and hilo and be already plan visit here again rental car big island jeep rental rent from here since they allow the summit mauna kea the rental the price for mauna kea sunset and stargaze tour for people would more expensive than rent and do ourselves they have minimum number days you have reserve the car for though pick and drop off the car be easy and they be very kind and responsive through email text and over the phone food recommendations pine tree cafe large selection foods great price delicious eat here twice grindz cafe much food for cheap want come back here well but they be close the second time come around nephi smokehouse usually don like smoke meats and sausages but this place build different be compare lot the restaurants go afterwards this place two ladies kitchen many choices mochi the time arrive the afternoon there be line and few options be already sell out but the line move quickly and be still able get large assortment flavor activities our highest recommendation manta ray night snorkel this be far the best activity do any the islands go with big island divers be not religious people but this felt like spiritual experience one go scuba dive where sit sea floor and the other snorkel the surface both get great view everything that happen word cannot describe the feel manta ray swim inch from your face monk seal look the manta ray confuse low cost and free activities our highest recommendation hawai volcanoes national park much not enough time be fortunate enough explore the lava tube ourselves arrive early the morning recommend the kilauea iki trail mauna kea sunset and stargaze very close second for our favorite activity arrive about two hours before sunset but even when start become crowd people be able spread out across multiple view areas the sunset be beautiful against the contrast the snow you be look from above the cloud rush head down just the sun dip could park the visitor center and stargaze but didn need most people didn stick around see the milky way with our own eye be breathtaking ahu days our first time ahu since be stay airbnb waikiki be expect more urban but be little more overwhelm than expect love spend time outdoors while this island be not our cup tea can see how great location for lot people rental car lucky owl car rental very similar kihei rent car frills and well price don expect bentley and you fine food recommendations leonard go very early the morning right when they open and be serve very quickly nothing beat fresh hot malasada before hike kono pass this place nearly every day and decide try one our last days wish try sooner their bombers burritos be fill and savory even have save half our own burritos since be much food go here twice the sunrise shack visit the locations haleiwa and waikiki smoothies be good but the star the show be the smoothie bowl this exactly what think when think acai smoothie bowl talk about the blue dream and monkey bowl all the time exactly what need for warm day watch surfers the north shore seven brothers after you work appetite from watch surfers from the beach yourself favor and head over seven brothers after days seafood nothing hit better than burger and home fry good activities our highest recommendation turtle canyon snorkel our charter with different company be cancel last minute but be able book one for the next day with live ocean tour leave early the morning which allow the water before many the other charter saw too many green sea turtle count the guide do great job keep safe distance from the turtle and give lot information throughout the snorkel kualoa ranch zipline our first experience zipline and love the tour guide be fun and well prepare the drive from the entrance the zipline base camp be mini tour some film locations which be nice bonus snorkel with shark go with one ocean dive after see recommendations online while this be one the most jaw drop things ever do the experience with the charter little disappoint sure every experience vary but this time seem like the crew care more about get their own gopro videos than make sure spend time see the shark would still recommend but only because how cool and amaze the shark be your mileage may vary chief luau love our experience with the old lahaina luau want attend one ahu the price be cheaper than others and after quick online search saw enough recommendations decide this place the experience felt little cheap funnily enough water park but the host and entertainers be fun the food be okay but don feel bad you eat meal before come here low cost and free activities our highest recommendation hanauma bay nature preserve be unable get reservations online try our luck with arrive the morning for walk ticket however seem like every other visit family have the same idea there be large backup the road lead into the entrance and once the gate open be free for all get into the park be very lucky get and get walk ticket the beach and reef be beautiful and serene the morning but quickly become crowd the morning go be one the first people the water and saw green sea turtle right away the reef be mostly very shallow with visibility vary wave roll compare snorkel sit maui and hawai big island be little underwhelmed the condition be glad visit here but would not try our chance with walk ticket again diamond head arrive the morning just before sunrise and make our way the top the sun be rise be very crowd the top with every inch rail fill with people view the sunrise regardless great view koko crater you do the manitou incline this should piece cake also nothing humble you like year old sprint past you you take your tenth break minutes arguably better view than diamond head you can see down into hanauma bay

hele bus the stop target and walk the rest the way about minutes into town get pretty late and be already dark there wasn really time see anything eat couple spam and egg musubi from the abc store and just go straight sleep day wake early and walk small public access bite coastline sit and relax strike conversation with lady live nearby who offer bottle water and lift magic sand beach after spend hour the beach take the trolley target and quickly buy snack before catch the bus hilo the bus arrive early but wait until the schedule time depart didn find the bus nearly unreliable see people claim online the toilets don work but the driver make quick stop honoka about the halfway point for people use the bathroom like greyhound style bus and the seat be pretty comfortable while do research for the trip be afraid take seat the bus that locals rely get around but none the bus take be ever even half full there drink eat the bus and enforce saw the driver yell group backpackers for try eat popcorn the trip be about hours listen music and chat bite older man sit behind also great way see the natural landscape the island this be favourite spot when the road come out from dense bite forest and then suddenly you greet with this sight after get hilo be around just sit the beach and watch the wave bite until dark and get spicy tonkotsu ramen nearby restaurant call kenichi then head bed day go two ladies kitchen because be very hype online and love mochi spend like half hour line but be pretty good more less spend the day just walk around hilo and explore the shop buy few souvenirs that would fit backpack get some local fruit the farmers market and check out the mokup papa discovery center which would recommend you interest marine biology maritime history go rainbow fall well take the bus there and just walk back the sun be intense get pretty bad sunburn hairline because wasn wear hat day plan hike volcanoes there bus that go there from hilo every couple hours you miss and end call lyft like do around dollars read online that the kipukapuaulu trail be pretty good for spot bird get drop off there but didn have any luck and when mention local couple out hike that be hop get some picture apapane they offer ride area they know have lot them and they be right spend the rest the day just hike around the park and get the last bus back hilo there be lot steam come from kilauea and notice be increase throughout the day remember wonder be go erupt soon and course do the day get home another thing notice be that not many people seem use the station they have around disinfect your boot sometimes they stop read the sign and then just walk past day honestly most the day be spend the bus make back kona time watch the sunset and get dinner some really sub par fish and chip and couple glass beer from restaurant don remember the name day go hakalau forest guide tour the main thing come for and saw all the beautiful forest bird except for the palila like this iwi which be definitely the highlight the trip hawai creeper alaw too be about hours total van and hours look bird but all have blast after get back have bowl udon soup from seiji sushi kona be too nervous ask for fork have figure out how use chopsticks very quickly and manage without make mess day make friends with another tourist she have rental car be able ride around with her bite go hike the trail be still try get better iwi picture didn happen and go the kaumana cave then drive around the island back kona stop gas station honoka use the bathroom and get little bread pudding there that be probably favourite thing eat hawai after get back kona go out drink and do some karaoke day friend and check out craft market kona and go few different beach look for sea turtle which find many kaloko honok hau historical park along with couple more endemic bird the hawaiian stilt and coots be hard even stay far enough away from the turtle because they be come close shore and the tide be fully there be only couple feet sand go leilani shave ice afterwards since be highly recommend online and be indeed pretty amaze don usually like the texture stuff like sno con but the ice be grind really fine and the flavour be very natural spend the last hour explore shop kona and buy myself jar the big island be ohia honey before get ride the airport and have fly out that night course completely forget that you can take large jar liquid your carry and the tsa take the jar well overall be pretty fun be little worry about hostility toward visitors when go since have pretty severe social anxiety and read online other tourists say that people hawaii be rude them that they wouldn back can confidently say didn experience anything like that the majority people encounter be polite anyone city would and some be very helpful don recommend try get around without vehicle unless you have choice do miss some the place want see like akaka fall umi and mauna kea and spend lot time the bus but be still worth and feel confident enough try international destination myself and maybe when get some drive practice come back someday and get rental car here one the few landscape picture take out the window the

strawberry salad appetizer that be pretty good hilo stay small airbnb someone property be obviously slightly larger than tiny home that they have build for some extra revenue couple years ago be well stock and since be the south side hilo be great for easy access vnp one thing note about hilo you drive place add like your time get anywhere outside the city due road closure for tree trim this be totally unexpected and early person give lot anxiety activities honomu goat dairy this be the main thing want hilo have blast the goats be cute the goat goods be delicious buy ton things and the woman work the counter tell not worry about pay for goat food and just give couple bag the edible goat goods cheese fudge and caramels be all amaze and be great snack for the rest the trip the woman work the counter also tell that want avoid pay for park akaka fall park outside the gate that be cool akaka fall be surprise that they be charge people for park and per person enter the park goat lady tell park outside the gate do and only pay for entry the park there be two paths once you walk down the initial step one lead toward the leave and about minute walk the fall and the other lead the right and lead you minute walk loop around the fall do the right path and end with nice walk around scenic drive our way back from the goat dairy and akaka fall saw sign for scenic drive and detour through

bike the tour guide byron and andres be both great answer question and also provide binoculars for use lava glow go back night see the lava glow park devastation trail head and follow the sign for lava glow down close road this be very easy walk and get the lava glow about when first arrive the view area be pack and be little disappoint but after about minutes the entire area seem clear get talk with another couple there and spend about hour chat with them while watch the lava bubble and watch the star which be pretty great while be there older woman come down and do assume traditional

one each the flavor try some there and then split the rest the next morning warm great with wet paper towel over the top low power the microwave south side punalu bake shop honestly pass this show and instantly felt like major tourist trap wait line for food then the front the line one the workers behind the counter drop something and splash brown liquid all over white clothe couldn leave line because have already wait minutes step order and ask the woman work the counter for warm wet paper towel try clean she offer dry one and ask she could wet she do then come back and ask what want never

some malasadas while husband wait for food go into the bathroom clean clothe finish minutes later and come out and be still wait for the soup be little surprise that have wait long for them scoop bowl soup but take the malasadas and find seat far away from the madness that be the inside couple minutes later husband walk over and say they have tell him they have run out that soup and be refund him take our malasadas and leave the malasadas be okay and think maybe malasadas just weren jam but after try tex know that punalu bake shop malasadas be just vastly inferior major pass this one punalu

VisitingHawaii,trip report kauai kauai trip report have great trip kauai and make even better some the suggestions this sub think would pay forward with trip report be there friday the follow monday split between poipu and princeville this trip be young heart couple without kid mid september some general observations dinner be hard most things close not earlier and dinner place seem mostly aim tourists with mediocre food fine din you want watch the sunset which be get dinner after be always challenge the best real local place mostly serve breakfast and lunch the scenery the north be amaze but the food the south be better with more options and less gear tourists you know where look and lihue wasn far that you couldn there everything take longer and business hours be let say flexible things be randomly close when they should have be open even the sign the door suggest they should open staff issue be clearly problem double check the days the week when something should open well the hours you aren from similar climate the heat and humidity really drain you and you just everything slower target and costco be near the airport suggest go there first and stock supply sunscreen surprisingly about the same price the mainland most chain store you be rent car sign for their program and add your number your rental you will skip most the line the regular line be least hour the vip line whatever be lot shorter far know you must through line there just pick car you have be the caribbean be scuba diver you probably win find the snorkel very impressive the coral isn very nice and only one spot tunnel do find the snorkel worth while base suggestion from here do the shaka guide tip you sign without buy they will send you coupon cod for few days glad do be little cheesy but definitely hear some stories and context wouldn have otherwise will say stay princeville felt bite bad stay airbnb know house huge issue the island and this neighborhood would normal suburban neighborhood anywhere else the but instead bore condo week really hat that for the most part this be rental vacation neighborhood instead for be for local families also hat how much waste space the golf course take things wish have time for more snorkel see hanapepe explore kapa poipu stay the marriott koala village be fantastic hotel and amaze pool love be able walk across the street and watch the ocean the rock swim beach that really walkable just go poipu beach the path along the water very nice activities waimea canyon this be really nice the view the end spectacular when you get the end the park the road the right for unobstructed view imo worth the day trip note that you have pay for park and park pass the end and the canyon view turtle poipu beach this be really cool every night around sunset turtle come the beach and rest be lucky and saw about turtle someone tell about this hadn read hear about otherwise also get see some seal the water spout hole cool but also live the pnw where there one can get much closer wasn overly impress but can see how impressive for others try snorkel beach house but the water be too rough go poipu beach and be quite busy saw some fish but really not that great helicopter tour doors off be very cool the view be amaze didn want boat tour because be concern about sea sickness and several people meet say they get seasick from the boat glad go with the helicopter felt perfectly safe but our guide wasn that great consider the price you need wear long sleeve shirt for wind reason but doesn really get that cold would have expect better guide haena state park get very lucky and be able get park ticket for our day have say for the effort and cost go didn think be worth you aren go the full hike the second beach partner and get the viewpoint and be very hot and sweaty the snorkel be better tunnel and bite trek just get the beach you aren go the full hike would say skip and beach that easier access like hannalei bay haena beach just go for beach isn really worth especially you need ride the shuttle tunnel this be far the best snorkel lot different kinds fish be lucky enough see couple turtle and ray but the warn about park be real there be about park spot and that go late the day and get lucky there be one spot otherwise you need park haena beach and walk along the beach you have people drop off your stuff and then have the driver park and walk back will say walk the beach isn easy hawaii you seem sink pretty far but you be into snorkel this be favorite spot trip tube this would cool thing another place but don think would waste day kauai basically tube through canal and tunnel that be use irrigate sugar cane field communication how the tour would work be really lack you take water and phone camera the trip the start think be pricey for only be the water for about hour would have rather have another day the beach snorkel anini beach this be great beach not crowd hanalei bay and have tree along the beach you get some shade the snorkel be better than poipu but far out even though shallow you aren comfortable swim far out wouldn recommend for snorkel hannalei bay beautiful beach the water be bite rough when be there but seem you one side the other the bay the water little calmer have the problem high tide be mid day basically every day be kauai the north recommend rent snorkel gear from hannalei surf they be super nice and include defog with the rental food crack poipu decent mexican food one the few place open past that isn sit down restaurant kukuiula fish hut the market crack be really good poke saenz ohana breakfast princeville good breakfast only open bubba burgers poipu but there be multiple locations solid burgers good onion ring little put off the sign that say they be short workers because people don want work saturday they stop let people line around because they close waikomo shave ice same spot kukuila best shave ice have hours be unreliable though wailua also really good shave ice but live portland where can get that any time think waikomo might better than wailua though koala fish market koala good poke like lihue poke company better both be good koala doesn have any seat and know what you want order before you get the window walk back the food cart pod the road sit lihue poke company lihue favorite poke lapperts poipu don think be worth the hype probably the best ice cream the island probably not the best ice cream you have ever have do one oahu and the ice cream seem better anuenue cafe poipu good breakfast long line also unpredictable hours they be close day they should have be open without sign reason sueoka market koala great plate lunch and the best musubi accord partner very reasonably price smiley grind lihue good plate lunch the gravy be delicious pineapple paradise dole whip food truck dole whip serve taiyaki the tayaki be really good kilauea fish market the poke be fine but be the worst rice have ever have be over cook and mushy they sell out even though they close you want get there kilauea pizza meh be food one the few place open past chicken barrel waimea meh be food be starve after spend the day waimea canyon and be about the only thing open waimea sunday night would not recommend unless the only thing open kalypso grill hanalei be food not amaze severely understaffed again one the few place open for dinner also go the farmer market hanalei bay and princeville saturday they be mostly hand craft and such and not much farm the produce be much more expensive than be expect will say have the best mango life even be overall good trip get very lucky with the weather and basically have rain everyone seem have favorite between north and south but honestly don really like both side the island for different reason you have the time split your time would recommend do that hope post can help someone plan their trip and thank you hopeful cranberry for all their suggestions

VisitingHawaii,oahu review all just finish the most magical week oahu and want share experience because know when book use lot different reddit review gonna break the hotel food and activities hope that this will help someone when decide what activities food eat oahu like others help for some background and go with partner who travel from jfk hnl via direct hour flight and stay for seven nights and eight days hotel decide stay hilton hawaiian village waikiki and be room the tapas tower have partial ocean view the room itself be spacious update and nice for two people the room contain small mini fridge pros good location friendly staff and clean facility beach access alot resort food that what you into personally always go off the resort con adult only pool hot tub the facility only have one hot tub and be always full children and under the pool be often full unsupervised children horse play well the pool close except for the tapas pool but this pool then become overcrowd and full children chair the pool ever people the pool early and claim there chair with towel unless you get early don count get chair microwave know most resort be like this but microwave would nice and then finally the biggest con ever park per day valet even more personally could not afford this with quick google search learn that could park for free the day the harbor lagoon block from the hotel and then night park the pay lot next the free park this lot be per hour and have max hour stay this end total per even which substantial save when compare the whop per day all all nice resort but younger couple feel would enjoy adults only resort more food gonna rate each out with be the best and be the worst dukes waikiki dukes pretty much the king touristy restaurants oahu that be say you can look past the extreme heat the wait area well the loud chatter the food pretty dynamite and the hula pie be the best dessert have our trip go back second time just for the hula pie also side note this where be propose our trip the service be awesome and fast well cafe kaila best breakfast the trip french toast and ice latte be amaze monkeypod olina boyfriend say this be the best place go the whole trip and order the fish sandwich beg differ though order ramen dish and be just okay they use fresh ingredients which cool and locally source items have good cocktail and mocktail menu allow venture the west side the island for night and see something different maguro spot hand down the best poke ever have life be also super affordable which cool have build your own option paia fresh seafood the fish tacos be amaze and think the seafood pasta be also amaze also affordable liliha bakery wasn crazy about this one the food be okay the pastries be also okay kind regret not go leonard instead surf and salsa food truck the north shore hide gem the pastor tacos be die for and the burrito be huge lanikai juice both get bowl and even go here twice awesome variety toppings and juices smoothies perfect after diamond head brunch rise and grind coffee kailua cute lil coffee shop back patio coffee be amaze and the breakfast food be also good affordable breakfast morning glass cafe truly come here because be gas almost everyone reddit arrive minutes early before open and sit the car til saw line form and jump the line they have unique menu and get the mac cheese pancakes which be awesome but didn think the coffee be all crack and the menu be limit far breakfast options egg things good amount food for per person quick service everyone be super nice activities research ton things before leave and narrow down the few things that do and can honestly say that everything do be worth the time and money diamond head must give really scenic view prepare for steep hike many stairs though give because fianc didn enjoy much kailua beach adventure rent tandem kayak from here for half day four hours boy be kayak way more challenge than expect lol be great workout and awesome experience the facility provide you different route options the one choose be the mile journey mokulua island this one they label expert route and can definitely see why start rain half way through our journey and the water be choppy make more difficult but the end result be amaze saw monk seal rest the rock which be super cool and the queen bath also this island little tide pool thing the island also nest habitat for certain species bird be cool see their natural habitat other rout suggest the facility include the canal lanikai beach and smaller island that be closer that have tide pool staff be super nice and helpful well snorkel hanauma bay magical experience truly saw sooo many beautiful tropical fish and many coral reef be breath take and worth the sunburnt back even saw parrot fish crunch rock and staff member tell that parrot fish accidentally eat rock have grinders their throat that grind the rock sand and they poop sand out she tell they poop lbs sand per year the only complaint have that you have get two days before you want order get ticket they sell out rather quickly and can see why this probably the cheapest snorkel option the island aside from buy snorkel gear from walmart and do yourself rentals cost roughly for flippers and mask for two people turtle beach and sunset beach the north shore easily our favorite activity go two days the turtle beach saw many turtle swim the ocean and wash shore there be also nest where the turtle lay their egg also swim the north shore felt be significantly better than the beach waikiki also walk around the shop the north shore which be nice rainy day activity dole plantation good for what be probably good activity you have kid just do the walk through garden tour almost miss the pineapples the garden walk through tour there only like pineapples grow honestly really only go for the dole whip and be amaze the pineapple juice taste like alcohol though hope this review help someone else plan their trip and narrow down options replyforward
VisitingHawaii,days kauai trip report early july this sub and hawaiivisitors be very helpful plan hawaii trip figure would pay forward post trip report for day kauai trip instead do day day itinerary just talk about the various aspects the trip accomodation attactions excursions food etc highlight overall be amaze trip personal highlight be the hanakapiai fall trail make sure get your ticket early and learn surf kiahuna beach felt little silly be the beginner surf zone with all the kid but have lot fun favourite food spot be ishihara market the best poke have kauai and pono market the kalua pig be amaze things watch for one thing didn quite realize be how car centric the island be previously usually visit europe for vacation use be able walk around town but kauai you couldn get anywhere without car from poipu where be stay be very hard find any food options that didn require drive except for expensive resort food even when something be within walk distance there be sidewalks and you have walk cycle the shoulder the road which felt unsafe time also city slicker not really use rural roads after dark and drive from lihue poipu after nightfall the first day be very uncomfortable especially when start rain and especially with all the highbeams from oncoming traffic lastly park be huge pain the popular attractions waimea canyon park queen bath haena beach things close really early recall that most fish market close the early afternoon didn open weekend and some attractions have odd hours this sometimes make trip plan annoy you be plan day trip the north and want visit kilauea lighthouse you have thur fri sit which might not possible you already book other excursions those days things be really expensive especially with tip the same thing toronto but find annoy how even when you take out the terminal prompt you tip minimum activities sit favourite activities be the hike from favourite least favourite they be hanakapiai fall kalalau trail hand down the best trail do you get beautiful view the pali coast plus the fall much better imo than secret fall have enough time would want the full kalalau trail instead remember book early and bring plenty water use hike canada and only bring but the heat kill and should have bring the recommend waimea canyon trail waipoo fall waimea canyon and kokee park be also great the canyon be beautiful though park the place where you buy ticket car person be pain be park the trailhead only have time this the trail waipoo fall be really good for the view the canyon but for some reason trail map alltrails didn actually lead the fall only the mini fall which didn realize ahead time there be also tons look out along the route definitely recommend hit many possible sleep giant east trail fun quick hike and down and you get good view the island but not great the other trail the list secret uluwehi fall kayak hike the trail itself be but be super crowd with tour group when go the morning the kayak trip be fern grotto route be close when go and you have share the river with barge etc edit add forget mention didn the tour group but rent kayak from kayak kauai the staff there be super nice but aware that you be do the rental you have car top your kayak which can little tricky especially since you try not scratch your rental car and then drive literally away the other side the river launch due some rule about the number kayak they can launch from the marina something you do group tour you don have worry about that mahaulepu trail makauwehi cave find the trail super hard follow there be ton unmarked detour part the trail also golf course do see seal gillan beach which be nice next time would just stop shipwreck beach and call day captain andy cave raft tour overall pretty good great able into the cave but be long ride from waimea pali next time probably opt for the heli tour instead be the raft also the snorkel package surf hoku watersport talk about this above be mostly kid take class kiahuna beach when go but be still really fun and beginner friendly other things do include snorkel poipu and lydgate kilauea lighthouse wailua fall personally think be not really worth the drive hanalei pier one thing really want but miss out be queen bath but get there pretty late the day and be impossible find park there be like spot the trailhead food favourite food the island be all the poke options favourite be ishihara market unfortunate be out the way otherwise definitely would have go back for more and pono market but also try kilauea fish market koloa fish market and konohiki seafood which be still very good and better fresher than poke could find toronto for shave ice only have time jojo and waikomo probably enjoy jojo more myself be also larger cheaper but waikomo use more natural flavour you into that only sit down restaurants go be kiawe root and rumfire poipu both be really good for fish dish but think the non fish dish both spot be comparable what you could get elsewhere you probably not miss out you skip those some other place hawaiian bbq nothing wrong with but you could better than fairly generic fast food for the same price their pork lau lau be not good what get from pono which be really good particularly enjoy the tat the leave and didn really get the appeal loco moco felt like fancier salisbury steak musubi literally spam sushi rice nori that you could make home hamura saimin stop here the way the airport be pretty good but would have be happier with another poke bowl myself crack be but have better burritos home savage shrimp overprice what what be imo other restaurants that be list but didn get chance visit be keoki paradise do not realize this place book out weeks ahead time fish express and mark place travel from canada car rental probably the least interest part the trip just add this for the benefit any canadian readers flight be the morning and pearson airport be completely pack get lucky and get through security quickly because be with unite didn have wait the secondary air canada wait area where they hold you before you allow join the security line the flight be otherwise uneventful know unite doesn have good review but from what could tell still much better than the air canada experience the moment rental car reservation kauai be with alamo issue there though didn realize there be shuttle lihue airport that take you the car rental location walk from the gate the first time car be compact be since didn any off roading but would have prefer jeep since there be several time where have park dirt park lot the side the road near beach park etc where the higher clearance would have be helpful accomodations kea stay the entire time kea poipu beach boutique luxury hotel like since be pretty quiet mostly couple and retire the families with kid tend stay locations with nicer pool get partial ocean view room which mean could see the ocean go the lanai but otherwise not be really nice for couple retreat and splurge for but not really worth you plan drive around and off the resort most days probably rental condo next time the kiahuna plantation resort next door seem very nice cheaper and right the water too couple other things note about the kea would not stay here with kid the pool tiny and there really not much the resort itself for kid they probably happier bigger resort like grand hyatt koloa land marriott waiohai the resort front onto the ocean but there rocky outcrop right front you can see google map there not really beach right front you have walk poipu beach kiahuna beach the walkway kiahuna beach also kind sketch but not big deal location otherwise awesome though be sunny every day poipu and love be able pop out early the morning see the turtle poipu beach the ocean front room look amaze but far can tell there huge difference between the ocean view room and the partial ocean view room stay here would either partial ocean view make sure you the floor the ocean front you can afford there

shore have climb the rock get safe get some nasty leg scrap wasn like almost drown but could head there quickly that part be not fun retrospect wish have choose somewhere super easy like baby beach better yet book tour have boat take you the snorkel spot and be able get the boat when you tire sound much better than swim yourself the spot and swim back despite be very much shake our snorkel experience get back the car and head the north side the coast nakalele blowhole this place be awesome there crazy windy overlook that fun stand for few moments then you can hike down get closer the blowhole and see the gorgeous coastline would have try snorkel the honolua bay marine reserve but be too scar and exhaust get back just drive back the same way come take about hour walk through lahaina and see the shop before make back kihei shower then shop and eat wailea finish the day back makena beach for sunset day try snorkel maluaka beach aka turtle town but be still too scar the wave

VisitingHawaii,tourist tour and review mostly waikiki restaurants long originally post this honolulu didn realize this sub exist this sub would have be really handy know about week earlier but hopefully this help others just wrap week stay waikiki have great time and want write down some experience about the restaurants go both for own note well for any other tourists who might come waikiki not sure just the hawaii air what but almost all the food eat be spectacular background family with two kid age and and fairly price insensitive the kid have pretty diverse palette but the end they be still kid this review will through that lens ymmv be here four years ago pre covid and want come back waikiki for all the outdoor activities and din this through the lens tourist unfortunately have inside information local contact choose the restaurants base online review which sometimes have questionable objectivity star rat be more stingy than would give yelp where restaurants live and die rat have breakdown rat the end while pretty price insensitive for try new restaurants keep mind price for repeat visit some restaurants may have different price adjust rat than initial rat saturday maragume udon rat star star price adjust logistical note walk short line go off hours repeat visit from our last trip love the fresh noodles and the price value proposition very high the line move quickly you usually don have wait too long probably come back different time the line go around the corner though you have any flexibility sunday paia fish market rat star logistical note walk line go bite early everything be but nothing be stand out food be kind one note pasta have ton butter walk past later time and there be huge line though evidently some people like lot zigu rat star logistical note walk line love all the food and our server be great kid especially like zigu and want back have favorite izakaya restaurant locally be great check this one out monday sato seafood rat star logistical note walk line only table mostly take out small menu fish be fresh and dish well season especially like the rice which often afterthought back home only reason this doesn get star there aren lot items the menu great once though thai issan waikiki rat star logistical note walk line leftovers be often good indicator how good restaurant because some the trick you can use make food taste better the restaurant fall apart the next day have some seafood panang curry leftover after heat the seafood still taste fresh and cook perfectly and the curry be possibly better than the first time around would happy this restaurant regular basis tuesday heavenly island lifestyle rat star logistical note walk repeat visit from last trip food quality be great and love the vibe the place aracino mare rat star logistical note reserve through opentable few nights prior repeat visit from last trip try not repeat restaurant visit single trip but this would have be vote for restaurant worth second visit the same trip pasta be fresh and superb and there be tons dish want try this definitely restaurant would regularly be home wednesday hihimanu sushi rat star star price adjust logistical note reserve through opentable few nights prior use uber love all the dish our sous chef either enjoy interact with kid hide his displeasure well they have some add ons which try even though pretty price insensitive expensive enough for that can see myself go regular basis despite how good the food be herringbone rat star star price adjust logistical note book through web site day not too sure this rat because have hard competition come the heel hihimanu sushi the food be solid but the price point not sure would recommend you be price sensitive thursday tim wan rat star logistical note walk line initially try cream pot but be unexpectedly close for the day end here usually order shrimp gau comparator among dim sum restaurants almost always the menu and easy mess either the shrimp itself overcook underseasoned the wrapper bad texture chalky etc this be among the best shrimp gau ever have the rest the dish be great too only down side be regular restaurant rotation the menu selection wasn wide would like zigu rat star logistical note book through opentable night before the philosophy that kid get such little agency their live when not too inconvenient but not often they become spoil course good let them have say the matter be go back restaurant this trip would have prefer aracino but one kid specifically ask back zigu give that they have little choice any our other restaurant choices decide be fine back have couple repeat dish but mostly try new ones and everything be great the staff be friendly even remember from our previous trip friday fresco italian restaurant rat star logistical note walk first try cream pot again but the line be too long go with our back plan aloha kitchen unfortunately that line be also long and kid be starve end fresco italian restaurant this be the first restaurant the week think myself tourist trap still our server be both friendly and adept though the place look under staff brunch take longer than should have food be fine but pretty mundane for that price point chef chai rat star logistical note book through opentable earlier the week use uber there be taste menu available that have sampler different appetizers and choice each entree and dessert and amazingly all them hit our taste profile all choose the taste menu and order appetizer escargot shrimp and mushroom since the kid have never have escargot before everything be great despite fairly large amount price insensitivity hard justify spend this amount money regular basis for meal but chef chai worth probably the most expensive restaurant that have make the regular rotation list have leave the next day those be all the restaurants be able try also find some nice market want remember not sure they be corporate family own but they be less commercial than some the other market this one definitely seem family own small but they stock lot for the space they also have small package spice and other things you might use you be cook this one might family own have stick butter which be surprisingly hard find this store be the only store walk distance find that have real butter this particular store location have almost internet footprint look like do find website for the mothership palama supermarket and sound like while chain still local one all all have great time everyone be friendly and be nice just chill and relax know this long post but both for remember the next time there and hopefully helpful any tourist look for place eat star reference star restaurant would regularly would recommend friends there star restaurant think be great but for some reason probably wouldn regularly would happy eat there friend suggest there would recommend friend try star restaurant think be fine would will there friend want there but probably wouldn recommend there be better options around star mediocre restaurant would not return and would suggest friends stay away from star something really bad happen here

hotel credit part the package and use the kukui restaurant site they also give two free glass champagne since be there for our anniversary which be very nice don drink but the gesture be kind either way the hotel staff be very kind the bartenders you generally have order through the kukui be not much they generally ignore you you not drink alcohol and just want order food this be common theme common theme everywhere not knock just kinda shitty since stop drink years ago that don buy alcohol get kinda push the side most place kukuis food be better than expect though the hotel itself be clean the beach right there and very nice park can bite mess one park lot bite hike and the other one for our tower have limit park but always seem get lucky and find spot they allow non hotel residents park there during the day make bite mess overall very much enjoy the stay the other guests be overall nice and the limit interactions have with staff be all very nice and accommodate food mark place awesome plate style lunch wife get chicken katsu get chicken cutlets and both love be lunch and dinner for the serve be huge its pretty close ligue airport love this place tiki tacos eat here twice and love pollo cabron be favorite and kailua pork be also good but all them be excellent and the people be very nice sams food be good service be not good and the other patrons be terrible the view be nice but this be not our crowd be much older crowd get piss drink once our server learn be not buy alcohol ghost the bus boy be the only one saw and have ask him twice would help find our server give him tip personally because be the only one actually pay attention the park lot also terrible with very limit spot and very tight plus factor people be drink monster sushi thai get chicken katsu and panang curry and enjoy both would go here twice but be close monday believe hanalei poke very good you the north end kauai very much enjoy and they have brown rice which be more difficult

breakfast spot lihue java kai probably our favorite coffee spot kauai get maui mocha and be good be pretty busy even the afternoon plus they have banana bread and other sweet treat adventure kauai backcountry adventure love this more than think would first you ride open air bus for about minutes hour tour the land get the spot get the intertubes you get visit their farm ranch and see some nice photo spot and ask question about kauai and get some nice dry humor that enjoy the inter tube itself pretty fun sometimes felt like be neverending tea cup ride disneyland and make bite dizzy and nearly impossible stop you will need use your hand and feet bounce off wall guide yourself and can slightly tax your back sit the tube for hour know old highly recommend this unique and love get lunch the end be nice little sandwich with chip and hit the spot captain andys lunch bbq snorkel these kinds trip be always toss the air because nature determine much apparently get lucky because do not hit huge wave least compare others water do get bite choppy near the coast but nothing huge the sun be very penetrate through cloud cover picture that day weren great but obviously the tour can control that the boat be be the star class be decently size but wish there be fewer people maybe least fewer expect many people with main character vibes this tour that believe they be the only people there and just say fuck everyone else that they think be their personal photoshoot and hate this because make feel like have aggressive get good photos and try relax and respectful with others this again not the tour fault not knock them just come with the territory more knock society and some part people that be way too selfish only get snorkel short time the water be quite choppy and the water be very murky and couldn see anything wife some few fish but that never saw anything look down but could really only see couple feet front uncontrollable force nature the crew be awesome and handle everything well make sure you tip them poipu beach must visit turtle come the beach towards the even depend the even and weather but can vary when they come hear its early and sometimes not until past when go there be many people swim that the people there serve protectors and set the boundaries protect the turtle tell that the crowd and people swim be scar them away even after turtle show people keep swim the channel they be use try get close them use common sense here people nature give them them their space be lucky able watch give them space get your picture and let others get see too poipu beach for sunset be very pretty and highly recommend bring plate lunch some dinner with you sit bench the beach and eat the sun go down not think you will regret anini beach favorite place swim

VisitingHawaii,visit hawaii from non native non local myself can someone local native other help understand the debate local natives not want tourists come any the islands those who say hop this conversation can respectful possible but know hard during such unimaginable time there abundance information be spread all social media platforms etc and quite frankly overwhelm for those who may plan trip but be be tell multiple conflict things many not easy decision for some many people be make out for multiple factor say what you will really just just hop gain understand from both side and not create further conflict and hopefully this can help some feel uncertain make the right decisions
VisitingHawaii,waikiki hotels may have do too much research husband and be plan book day stay ahu start the week may want stay somewhere centrally locate and figure waikiki would ideal also want the beach very short distance from think moana surfrider be the one beachfront plenty amenities reasonably price for what advertise but after read probably too many review seem like the room be get date and the room people think they pay for end not be available but research star property like the royal hawaiian yield similar result higher price point halekulani seem deliver the quality the room but not the beach just worry go get there and give room that less than what be expect know that win spend huge amount time the room but this our first real vacation since really want get the most out our trip any advice for reliable hotel experience waikiki

overhear people dinner that shortly after get car they be run out vehicles people have take whatever be available minivans suvs instead the compact they reserve around the car rental agency tell everyone take uber their resort for most rid and very limit availability and come back tomorrow morning wait for car apparently this every day occurrence would extremely cautious when book your flight

get dinner break mouth grindz which be delicious order the kalua pork and beef bulgogi with rice and mac salad portion be large enough fee for two meals and the place be not busy have read could probably wait about minutes for the food hit the kta for groceries and always its about twice the price what you would pay the mainland be east coast time go bed around sunday kona south coast head out pretty early for the shaka guide south island epic coastal journey main highlight be uhonua honaunau national historic park punalu bake shop punalu black sand beach and the south point do not volcanoes this day although the tour include uhonua honaunau national historic park be beautiful and excellent preservation native hawaiian architecture sometimes there can turtle here but didn see any today do see massive herd the goats that be all over the island have lunch punalu bake shop have two sandwich that be good for the price and buy three their malasadas hadn hear the malasadas from here but they be pretty good the black sand beach be very interest and do see turtle sunbathe here south point be worth the ride down be very sunny and windy mindful your outfit choices grab shave ice from mobile stand that be set and be enjoyable lot locals fish down here but didn see anybody the big cliff jump into the ocean that be absolutely not interest one thing notice today the tour bus must have be popular route for them because there be least every place stop and soon enough everything be swarm the line punalu bake shop go from people deep very quickly just mindful you pull somewhere and see these vans its probably go wait for whatever you there for get back the hotel around and decide take walk down ali drive not sure they this every day just some but they have section ali drive close and set with dozens local vendors find park spot that be hour and walk around there for bite decide take our chance and move the car hop find somewhere cheaper park for dinner be successful and end huggo the rock and be tell would about minutes for table for note most all the restaurants along this strip not take reservations be closer and be seat have virgin mojito which mostly just taste like sour mix expectations be low be fine get the fry shrimp and chip and husband get fish tacos bite goof when they initially bring out fish and chip for but they quickly rectify and even bring complimentary dessert both really enjoy our meals that night they have live music and even hula dance watch the sunset from our table and head home since have early wake the next day monday hawai volcanoes you didn know one the volcanoes kilauea within the currently erupt and really want see the lava glow the dark however be pretty top things and know that be majorly crowd night see take advantage be east coast time and wake try get there before sunrise get out time and manage get there shortly before be still pretty busy that time but very manageable first stop the kilauea iki overlook and get some great picture and take some time view the lava glow then because have the time drive the devastation trail park lot and do the short hike view the lava from only half mile away they say this hike mile each way but that simply not true be half mile each way maximum get their after the sun have begin rise but still get really nice view after sunrise quickly refresh the visitor center than get start with the main hike have plan for the day the kilauea iki trail and crater rim trail this hike be miles round trip and about feet elevation gain be not challenge all until your ascent out the crater walk down through the crater be such unique ecosystem and definitely unlike anything see before be happy have do total take less than two hours and that include stop the thurston lava tube eat pack lunch sandwich around because have get early and be famish will say that there be really options for food this national park the volcano house hotel have restaurant but from understand sit down restaurant which do not interest head down chain craters road use the shaka guide tour they will tell you pull off lot place but didn think they be all necessary certain point when you see craters they all start look the same drive through the lava field be interest and eventually make down the sea arch which be nice photo start the long drive back kona around noon spend the even relax the hotel pool and eat our leftovers from break mouth another early bed time for tuesday hilton waikoloa village resort pass husband and have be comment non stop about how lucky have get with the rental car our room location and kilauea erupt much well today all our luck run out have book cabana the hilton waikoloa village resort pass pretty much this every trip just ensure have one really nice pool day arrive shortly before ten and get check our cabana the staff here be all nice and basically let have the pick whatever cabana want briefly swim the pool and then do some snorkel the lagoon area they have saw some really beautiful fish but turtle although apparently be not the right spot for them overnight husband have start feel unwell but felt better the morning figure maybe have hangover around noon become clear that wasn hangover and instead be flare husband chronic illness go back our hotel enjoy the day pass but would not ever stay this resort the architecture be kind weird and gaudy find the beverage price astronomical even for resort for can soda order food here from one the restaurants and be downright horrible spend the majority the day just let him rest and hop that would feel better the next day wednesday attempt hilo have plan the shaka guide north island loop tour today because want visit the big farmer market hilo husband be feel better the morning and think would okay off go make across saddle road and into hilo when become apparent that be not go able continue the day stop briefly the kta hilo pick few things and immediately turn back around and drive the hour and half back kona pick some thai food from original thai cuisine kona and think be just and very expensive most things be hawai go the pool the resort for bite and then decide try out for drink and dessert land don mai tai husband get mai tai flight and get virgin pina colada also order some shrimp for appetizer husband have about two sip his drink before feel bad again ask for the check and head back the hotel feel for the bartender who probably wonder what be wrong with the mai tai flight make that only take one sip and leave thursday hapuna beach and kohala coast husband be again feel moderately better this morning decide play kind close home case take turn and have leave go hapuna beach which specifically pick because they have facilities bathrooms shower when arrive quickly learn that there be water the entire beach mean bathrooms place wash off sand this beach would have be perfect have run water the beach itself be beautiful and the water be crystal clear there be quite large wave quickly realize would not snorkel lot people be boogie board and appear have fun stay about two hours after that be consider do the shaka guide kohala coast tour because start pretty much where be but husband be feel iffy go the queen marketplace waikoloa village that could some shop and could wait out and see want home the tour the market place outdoor shop center that have some name brand store crocs pacsun etc but also lot hawaiian specialty store and art galleries do some souvenir shop while husband recoup eventually decide the kohala coast tour highlight this tour be the ukohola heiau national historic site the statue king kamehameha polulu valley lookout and drive through waimea the tour be nice but nothing be really standout there be hike could have do into the polulu valley but weren feel really enjoy drive through the roll hill waimea and hear the stories the shaka guide tour always for dinner go jackie rey ohana grill do make reservation here and still wait bite when get there have the new york strip and husband have the mahi mahi think food be just okay but husband really like his be his first meal about three days service from jeremy be wonderful and really enjoy lilikoi faux jito overall be fine place but think the price be steep for restaurant that really have ambiance speak should also mention originally have ticket book fly honolulu just for the day and visit the uss arizona the diamond head hike and visit shop near waikiki decide the night before that this be absolutely not happen and cut our losses friday hilo finally husband finally feel mostly recover finally head into hilo saw really nice beach rainbow fall the hawai tropical botanical garden akaka fall boil pot waipio valley lookout and eat tex malasadas have lunch tacos jaliscos hilo which be the best street tacos ever have and very reasonably price all things consider enjoy rainbow fall more than akaka fall akaka fall doesn seem worth the you pay just park and be inundate with people the point that isn even enjoyable you take the whole loop around akaka fall just know that lot stairs least way more than expect be happy that make tex try their malasadas they be different than the ones punalu bake shop but good their own way much prefer the dough and sugar the outside tex but felt like the fill punalu be better the tropical botanical garden be the highlight the day both really enjoy plant and find this spot interest and beautiful wasn sure would worth the price tag but very glad do waipio valley be heavily cover with vog didn feel that waipio valley nor polulu valley compare all the the beauty the napali coast kauai back kona have burger from island ono loa grill that be really good the fry be actually the best part watch one final sunset and go bed saturday departure day our last day pack the morning and go grindz cafe for breakfast have crab cake egg benedict and husband have corn beef egg benedict seem arrive just before the hoard they be able take our order right away and food come out quickly when be leave line be people deep return the rental and get the airport for our trip back seattle for another overnight layover before head actual home sunday be both feel pretty emotional and bum the trip end even though be able things thursday and friday husband still wasn feel well and wasn able enjoy himself couple with how much fun have the first two days be feel very disappoint how the rest have go course the risk you take and not everything can sunshine and rainbows every time can confidently say make the best and that enjoy all the time get spend with love tough fully give accurate assessment the big island due the circumstances that be say definitely enjoy kauai more and think would still the same have be able everything want the big island while know the drive time between place ahead time underestimate the impact that would have who generally like drive the drive place and then promptly turn around due illness didn help either the big island definitely remarkable for all lava but enjoy the lush tropical scenery kauai more the only thing didn get the big island that want be stargaze mauna kea have few opportunities during the day but didn feel would worth you also cannot the summit you be pregnant wasn sure that would worth just the visitor center especially with the vog situation hope this trip report be helpful someone and happy answer any question anyone may have
VisitingHawaii,psa not the north shore today unless you want stick traffic for hours huge surf tournament take place today waimea bay the eddie the first time this event be hold since before covid and crowd start camp out for yesterday cars have start line for miles along the highway this morning and traffic expect back past haleiwa and kahuku you be plan try see the north shore today move your plan different day win worth sit literal hours traffic you try watch the tournament and you not there already advice would get haleiwa you will probably still hit traffic and bike from there update the bus waimea bay from ala moana

similar this before trip kauai and find really helpful hope you all find this helpful too little about be childfree couple and live oregon this be our second trip kauai be very much foodies and enjoy food experience range from small hole the wall the best restaurants portland note when comment that something expensive keep mind price kauai know everything more expensive there and know eat out just more expensive everywhere right now say something expensive mean expensive even for kauai opinion here list everywhere eat kauai and what think puka dog poipu this be the first place husband and go after land delicious but not quite good remember from seven years ago remember the inside the bun be more crispy before that be nit picky though super tasty and concept that unique kauai think pretty much must also their fresh lemonade delicious the newer location great because you can easily eat poipu beach lilikoi lihue this place go purely out convenience because be stay the royal sonesta and be close the food be good not great also opinion that every item the menu be more than should have be for what you get again keep mind kauai price and inflation general get kalua pork sandwich and come homemade bread which think be nice touch kukui lihue this the restaurant the royal sonesta also overprice and just okay probably wouldn have eat there didn have din credit there from costco who book our trip through drink be tasty but expensive and weak which know normal for resort the best thing have there be the acai bowl for breakfast even though not fresh acai bowl clearly pre make scoopable product but the serve size be good and the fresh fruit be delicious you have din credit there recommend use breakfast try lunch there and be just okay lovely service nawiliwili tavern lihue also close the sonesta but haven from the touristy place that surround dive bar and love much you like dive bar you would like too great place hang out chat with locals and other down earth tourists get less expensive drink play pool free and sing karaoke hope this place stay there forever kenji burger koloa old town eat the koloa location fun atmosphere with patio style din decent price the food concepts be good but find our meals under season overall think decent choice for the price retrospect would probably opt try one the food cart the area instead mango koloa old town this little ice cream shop that one the newer build koloa old town they have multiple flavor dole whip which what get get the mango flavor and very much enjoy get the kid size they be generous with their portion kauai bbq and boba lihue this one the food cart near the sonesta fairly good hawaiian food fair price rice be little mushy and the beef be bite jerky like texture but the mac salad and the bbq chicken be delicious aloha liege waffle lihue this the other food cart near the sonesta that eat absolutely delicious highly recommend get one with fresh fruit fresh fruit always good choice hawaii like that they chop the waffle into piece easier eat would have eat there multiple time have the chance kauai beer company lihue menu doesn have ton options but the food quite good husband say their reuben be one the best ever have beers be tasty they also have cool shirt bar acuda hanalei the best meal have the island worth you want splurge fancier meal expensive but felt the value match the quality make sure you get your reservations month advance saw many people be turn away the concept spanish tapas but would say more just modern american highly recommend kauai bakery and coffee lihue you have experience malasadas hawaii and this good place tropical dream ice cream kapa have some fun flavor but the scoop be tiny and expensive recommend go wailua shave ice which locate the same shop center only reason didn there because they close the second walk but have visit their portland location several time they be amaze sunrise coffee lihue little cart great not big coffee drinker but this be the smoothest least bitter coffee have ever have life also get the avocado toast which be delicious and big enough for husband and share chicken barrel waimea pretty decent bbq you use amaze bbq this isn the side be little bland the mac salad be watery but the property beautiful and really nice sit outside there weren any sign say you couldn husband and wander around after eat and enjoy the beach view and the lovely unique tree the property and they have this fun setup with beer where you get token and you can pour yourself they have many choices and be fun sample different kinds and just pay for what you drink think this nice choice for stop your way back from the canyon waikomo shave ice koloa this tiny shave ice cart the park lot crack all their syrups be naturally flavor and very much enjoy shave ice there there be long line but think be worth noka grill lihue husband have breakfast burrito there and say be just okay and very expensive you could probably pass this place scorpacciata pizza lihue really good be understaffed when go but really enjoy what get and like sit the little patio particular remember fry that come with pesto aioli kind dip sauce that really love kountry kitchen kapa prepare wait absolutely delicious but try saturday morning and be pack you can add your name the list through their website which do and recommend you well even then take about hour and half for table their french toast look good but be sell out the time be seat love the lavender latte will back next time come kauai duke kitchen lihue end go here last minute just because be pour down rain and could walk from the sonesta food be decent didn blow away but be good ish drink be about the same price the bar sonesta but bigger and better the little salad bar be surprisingly good don know they have option just get that but they do would think about get for lighter meal really enjoy the selection specialty pasta salads good service and nice ambiance there indoor waterfall and they have live music most nights hapa kaua koloa they have very recently open when be there and could tell they be still work out some kink spendy but the food worth the cost opinion what throw off and don know they change this since visit not be that semi upscale restaurant but you order the counter therefore the counter have quite long line there be plenty waitstaff drop off food and drink really just didn understand why they weren take order table again maybe they be just try work out the kink the new restaurant decide there because the owners previously have restaurant portland would say the food be par with something you find portland honorable mention and couple note get the specialty pie mcdonalds you want get mauna loa macadamia nut all varieties the best price be walmart they have other fun specialty snack well and even affordable hawaiian style clothe you look for have really good and special unique snack costco have some great specialty snack items be big and tough fit suitcase but be really happy get big box kauai kookies that have be able share with friends and family back home will definitely back kauai miss your favorite spot let know and will make sure put our

VisitingHawaii,pearl harbor trip report with pragmatics this long but want include lot the practical detail help others prelude have problem sign for arizona memorial reservations already have the recreation gov account and app set use the web site you can easily find the day mark for the day you want visit the east coast reservation slot be release edt when switch est just set reminder tell book the reservations there be mad bang the keyboard unlike disney din reservations choose this give comfortable buffer for eat breakfast and get pearl harbor without panic while not force mid day break routine take the boat the memorial day our visit stay hilton hawaiian village pick our first full day oahu our pearl harbor day but have the previous afternoon get the lay the land keep our biological clock closer california time help get early and get bed early get around sit down breakfast around just after they open grab lyft that pick about minute wait and arrive pearl harbor around take few minutes find the hotel designate rideshare pickup spot from where order the lyft pearl harbor be prepare for full tsa style pat down but get be trivial have clear plastic stadium backpack for water bottle not transparent and camera stuff and wear cargo short for other items but all the guard do be ask look both side the backpack and then wave retrospect probably could have bring camera battery wallet about inch long turn out there be water main break essentially make the water fountains non potable and our water bottle useless that day the map page doesn have the map well label the lower map the main visitor center area and the part the upper map label pearl harbor national memorial oahu proper you can see the submarine museum right there the north end the right after the entrance gate be surprise see huge standby line for the arizona have think they have stop do that there be well over people line around hop get since the line didn make sense walk past and find the entrance line for people with reservations along with the sign identify the standby line the reservation line be empty they have already seat people for the boat the theater regret not ask one the rangers how the standby line function since admission the memorial free consider this you weren able book reservations but can show very early the site the time our reservation the standby line have shrink maybe and be nonexistent later use our time before the reservation see the attack exhibit one two small museums near the theater and board area for the arizona well the outside exhibit the entire loop contain the point label contemplation circle and remembrance circle the map go the reservation line around and be seat the theater immediately able get center seat two things be non standard about our introduction before board first because repair the pier they only use one board area and not have people see their short film about the attack before board second rather than whatever usual ranger talk they normally have be join school group guess graders and the teacher lead discussion with them she do mix ask her students about facts and about feel compare the attack bully but also mention the oil embargo against japan believe the students unlike most the rest saw the film first someone who long out school felt truly lucky and privilege experience that rather than the stock ranger talk not that the rangers be bad have plenty national historic sit massachusetts and the rangers be always excellent the ones that help out the teacher be too then board the boat pay attention the rangers about both board line be open luckily grab picture the arizona memorial build when be close its dock since they didn want anyone pause for picture the dock until after everyone be off the boat but don worry there time come outside while the boat away win say much about the memorial itself other than be choke time listen any talk give the shrine section one the display help orient myself with regard the ship and patience allow see more the ship underwater when get back quickly use the bathroom and then pick the shuttle bus the right the museum and take the uss missouri moor ford island the missouri have nice lunch from one the food truck and then board the missouri only have wait couple minutes for the next tour group highly recommend do this the volunteer tour guide be very knowledgeable and energetic occasionally apologize for talk fast after some browse the deck and eavesdrop what other guide say about the sign ceremony go below follow the self guide tour the ship have tour the uss massachusetts few weeks earlier which set different expectations the self guide tour the missouri well organize and certainly worth the time but only go down one level be two the massachusetts isn complete term signage and info but let you see much more the ship take much longer both ship be worth visit you ever make massachusetts outside the entrance the missouri the uss oklahoma memorial this just the display name show the first picture suppose just see isn reward the guide tour with ranger but the latter which visit the oklahoma and utah memorials just three days week once each day still take few minutes look while wait for the bus the bus stop the aviation museum next but have previously decide not visit after get back the main visitor center go the other indoor exhibit road war and bathrooms the snack bar have close early and with the water fountain inoperative leave the pearl harbor around be full very reward day and for emotional even though neither nor anyone know lose people pearl harbor ever back honolulu probably win visit the arizona memorial again but would consider both the submarine and aviation museums

scenic drive northern michigan that be way prettier than the road hana the only things worth stop for be waianapanapa state park and the pipiwai trail and maybe the keanae arboretum just look the rainbow eucalyptus tree close and the roadside lava tube other than that be not impress the beach the waterfalls and be exhaust and unpopular opinion but aunty sandy banana bread overrate have lunch

VisitingHawaii,kauai october trip review after much help from this wonderful subreddit family two boys and wife and go kauai during the first week october just want share trip help others they help day arrive around noon and go immediately baggage claim pick our luggage and two car seat hate those things rent car from alamo line and drive straight lawai market which find rather unimpressive little let down since many people recommend have their box lunch they be out most things and buy few fruit and pastries for the kid then check koloa land resort which really beautiful resort with great hospitality and pretty fun pool they be apparently vote pool america guess have two water slide water fall grotto infinity pool adults only pool and smaller kid pool go the pool everyday dinner be merrimen and while be our most expensive dinner be fantastic amaze view during sunset with great service nice wine start mac nut crust swordfish with herb rice and scallop shrimp with garlic noods for parent quesadillas and fry for kid not surprisingly after the long day and time zone difference the boys pass out during dinner and finish our meals and complimentary desert with them sleep day have small brekkie our bedroom villa the whole week with assortment pastries and fruit pick locally and the resort marketplace wish get least partial ocean front view though our view from the lanai be bueno lunch be keoki paradise and the food be barely average fish tacos and korean fry chicken for and teriyaki chicken and fry for the boys very slow service despite empty restaurant and unimpressive food average spend the day the pool but call early due need get ready for family photoshoot shipwreck beach during sunset worst experience life get swarm beach nats the entire time only photos turn out nice though dinner be suppose bubba burger but due poor plan close mondays opt for bangkok happy bowl thai bistro and sushi bar the worst meal our trip would never eat recommend that place anyone who ever have thai you better off go sleep without dinner kid enjoy lappert ice cream while wait suppose this be the only bad day our trip lol day head out around for waimea canyon lookout easy drive and wonderful site very obvious why they call the grand canyon the pacific after short stay head back and get bubba for early lunch the cashier be unfriendly but the food be really good teriyaki burg for the wife and regular and double burgs for the kid and chili fry be great too water down drink however check out poipu beach and boy be crowd be still lot fun and get see bunch fish and turtle the water calm enough for younger kid but not nearly clear remember some other hawaiian water have waikomo shave ice the way back the pool good shave ice dinner be the dolphin poipu good temaki and maki wife like the poke bowl and chowder kid share the keiki ahi meal day have brunch kalaheo cafe which be great place not long wait either for their typical american brekkie meals try out baby beach which didn really like the water be rather rough even quite clear and the beach decline steeply even the little enclose area with the rock be rough not worth unless there low tide and the park be limit back the pool for more water slide fun dinner be duke kauai for the food and view probably our favorite dinner be seat right the edge with spectacular view great service and food crab wontons be fantastic wine be good and rib and chicken plate be delicious not favorite rib but the huli chicken be amaze wife really like her seafood curry well and kid enjoy their mac and cheese and fruit they also give hula pie the house for birthday delish free valet park too find small abc store finally nearby and grab some kauai tshirts day go back kalaheo cafe for their brunch wife try out their loco moco and get spam egg and rice plate which basically what eat back home but somehow taste better lol decent pancakes for the kid but they enjoy their fruit again stop uncle shave ice and think be back poipu beach lot fun but the kid want back the water slide the resort pool but before head back stop puka dog for few hot dog and lemonade don know they our order but both the grownups dog be not spicy all even though order jalape spicy and there just way too much bread dog ratio the toppings be nice and the lemonade be delicious however really don get the hype behind this joint but glad try but be just decent the kid really enjoy them though dinner be again bubba could try their double teriyaki burg better than the original think water down drink again something wrong with their fountain drink mix ratio the resort offer free mores night and the kid have fun with that great resort day time fly back home decide with daddy for their oxtail soup over tip top cafe go way early expect line but get seat right away their american brekkie be good especially their pancakes but their oxtail soup be bomb wish try out tip top oxtail soup try out some local pastries the bakery next door ensamada and puto be tasty too before leave over the airport you can tell with two young kid our adventure excursion options be limit but still really have amaze time the resort be top notch and have washer and dryer along with full kitchen the villa be convenient thank this subreddit for help plan the trip allow family and have wonderful birthday week the locals be very friendly and go miss this island

VisitingHawaii,august kauai trip report our family parent boys years old enjoy our kauai vacation right before their school year start please see below detail for our trip and please ask any question day the flight be uneventful and about hrs and land around and note that lihue airport really small consist total gate get the bag be quick and efficient honestly somewhat contrary what see hawaii time the rental car shuttle for avis budget have extremely long line and take the bus make but finally get our rental car and vacation start be stay the grand hyatt and begin make our way koloa where plan stop for lunch the way the hotel and kill little time since check be decide get poke koloa fish market for the adults and sueoka store for the boys koloa be not problem but when go order sueoka for some plate lunch be tell be minimum minutes now minutes may not seem like lot unless you get hungry kid and might well have be hours deviate and end drive get them food from keoki paradise decide eat keoki definitely have nice cor and lay back feel but decide get and head the hotel eat out lunch get the hotel prior our check but fortunately they provide access the grand club plus give drink vouchers use the pool while wait for our room wander the club and be fairly spacious and be finally able relax and eat our first meal kauai do end get into the room about minutes prior the official check time which be nice and be able change more appropriate kauai attire could head the farmer market the kaua culinary market which be only hold wednesday afternoons be nice walk around and see what there be for sale but our goal be because have read that this be the only place could get monkeypod jam which be one the things hear be fairly unique kauai even though be pretty full also stop the right slice table and get slice pie mango lilikoi and macadamia nut head back the hotel and there be enough time and daylight hit one the many pool the hyatt throughout the trip there be many pool and close beach access that never seem overly crowd but also notice that around people start leave the pool this end be perfect for the boys the slide close and they basically go non stop the slide for good minutes this time due jetlag be nearly west coast time go back the hotel and grab light meal the grand club this will recur theme and go the room relax and ultimately get some much need rest day luckily our family typically early risers that plus bite jet lag have early which be great because be try leave early hit few stop prior our schedule helicopter tour breakfast be the grand club and get our car and head out about first stop even though just eat be bakery hear the banana bread be great there nice little store with very friendly employees but ultimately felt be basically really nice coffee shop our next stop however be one wife favorites and that be kauai bakery where purchase malasadas ube guava and cream take our goodies and head for couple quick waterfall view have decide not any hike this trip be look for view that could see from the road with that mind hit the lookouts for wailua and opaekaa fall park for wailua be limit about spot would advise get there earlier particularly you want hike down there wailua fall be pretty spectacular but could see that hike down the pool would have be worthwhile opaekaa fall have much larger park lot but the fall be also much farther away each view probably only need about minutes head for our helicopter tour with blue hawaiian because our kid be not old enough do not book the open door helicopter and the configuration the helicopter be seat the back and the front when book decide pay extra upgrade our seat guarantee front row the day before receive call from blue hawaiian basically say that our guarantee seat be unavailable and would get refund the explanation that receive be that someone have book the seat few days before they have honor that reservation main annoyance be how could have book couple months ago and only find out the day before our tour be also too late change different day relevant for another tour book just have with ultimately still have blast and even one boys who say didn like helicopters prior the tour grudgingly admit have great time one highlight for wife be huge bts fan she be able happily chat with ashley about bts while ashley be assist seat her the helicopter and then top that greg who be our pilot apparently also have fair amount knowledge bts and reference the army greg be great pilot who be hilarious and provide some interest facts during the tour feet back the grind and be hungry surprise but really try eat many the local place possible when vacation originally the plan be get hamura saimin and grab mark place and find place eat however read that mark place likely have similar wait sueoko decide postpone mark big mistake and just eat hamura hamura nice local saimin restaurant run auntie the menu fairly basic and simple but that more than when the food wonderful end get sumo bowl which end share between the parent and one son and get our other son his own bowl also get few chicken skewer which be promptly devour felt that the food be really do well because even though pretty warm with still happily slurp the noodles and drink the soup enjoy much stop one more time before the end the vacation our stomach full once again move and head lydgate farm for chocolate taste base recommendation family friend who have recently visit the chocolate be very tasty and the two ladies provide sample and historical context be extremely friendly one note caution pass one the local school the way and didn think much but there be major traffic jam around all the parent be pick their kid just something note you there during the school year start make our way back the hotel with more plan stop along the way among them be one the two abc store kauai be oahu many time and wife be surprise that abc wasn all over this abc store be convenient because let honest be there for the wailua shave ice end get lava flow which fresh pineapple juice haupia foam plus strawberries and pineapple top absolutely delicious and welcome treat the warm weather our last stop the way back the hotel be costco be interest see some the more unique things there and end get some sushi for dinner plus some snack and gift for friends and family back home and with that our with that our first full day come end can you believe talk much for hours kauai day our original plan be ipu beach and then ziplining tour with koloa zipline but once again hawaii time strike again two days before leave receive email say that our tour have be cancel and they would refund be slightly annoy that didn get any information beyond that and naturally be only few days away there be absolutely nothing that be available for four try look all the other ziplines kayak tour etc do end call and supposedly there be not enough guide work they have cancel some tour find extremely inconvenient especially when tour be book months out and find replacement impossible plus the fact that they didn even say sorry once but you just have adjust after all vacation rant over end shift our plan for another day friday and get the car and head west see waimei canyon one note the distance aren very far from place place but you basically can drive faster than mph most place be from california be quite the adjustment especially since most roads be also one lane each way you get some really fantastic view and would encourage early go the further point kila lookout and make our way back kalalau lookout and then waimea canyon lookout and start get progressively more crowd addition have read somewhere try early because would either start get foggy reduce the view start rain which end do around noon fortunately because start early be able grab quick lunch ishihara market which supermarket that have tons poke pre make lunch box well lunch box order the menu change daily end get the pork cutlet lunch the kalua pork lunch plus some poke and eat the table outside and then go off schedule because didn realize jojo shave ice be minute walk away and wander and order local north shore jojo suppose know because they make their own syrup and there macadamia nut ice cream the bottom order the big kahuna which end be large our son head and will have say that feel that the best shave ice have ever eat our way back end stop the salty wahine kauai coffee kauai kookie and right slice store get more local flavor take home well except for the pie right slice that end stomach that even have reservations the beach house restaurant be look for somewhere with great sunset view the location and the view do not disappoint neither do the service which be excellent the food however do not seem any better than the local place have be eat for quarter the price day saturday be our plan head the north shore and then make our way back for our mountain tube adventure the afternoon mention above not that far actual miles but you can drive overly fast but you know just enjoy the view and the drive our first stop be the foodland princeville where grab some more local items such uncle mikey dry fruit and anahola granola plus some poke right next the foodland be lookouts hanalei valley and hanalei bay which be nice view but something that only require minutes max each stop then head hanalei and encounter the small bridge which only one way traffic be allow get through that arrive hanalei and head towards the pier want jump off the pier and into the ocean again pay get there early nearly all the spot be take one note for safety believe the morning be low tide because do not seem too deep the more shallow part be about and top off about other areas youngest son be trooper and jump once himself and once with before declare that be terrify about the drop probably clean bite and head hanalei grab lunch and head back for our tube hanalei small surfer town once you find park you can pretty much walk everywhere within few minutes and have plan get taro donuts honey grail kalua grill cheese pink and poke bowl hanalei poke the first two do not disappoint try the miso honey and haole donuts note that this not simple donut shop where you just order and food truck which everything make order and the donuts take few minutes and come out pip hot next stop be pink and again everything make order and they basically only take one order time although they be know for their ice cream be there for the hawaiian grill cheese which be grill cheese with kalua pork and pineapple be excellent and the last shop be one be excite for really enjoy poke and hanalei poke suppose one the best get there right before they open however look pretty empty the door and crush there handwritten sign that simply say close saturdays be tell wife and there be local load pickup front the store and they mention difficult find people work saturdays which why they be close leave hanalei without our poke and head back our tube adventure check sign our waivers get our helmets with flashlights and gloves and get into the truck transport the plantation for our adventure along the

the drive be beautiful eventually make punalu bake shop the line look really long but you the restroom area there actually another line idk they be the same line but line the second line grab the malasadas get the bismark pineapple and guava flavor all yummy but sweet decadent find table outdoors seat and bird watch for while while eat then drive punalu black sand beach and decide just check

you wait for get dark check out the lava eruptions that actually lot hours end do way more than have expect first drive the entire chain craters road beautiful and stop each sight take photos make the end and walk check the sea arch out and drive back then plan only the lava tube hike but the park lot be full very small one park the kilauea iki trailhead when realize this trail literally go down crater and could walk across top the lava tube be like okay let be already ish this point do walk through the lava tube actually have idea be go through have come out and be like wait where the lava tube lol think walk through regular tunnel bad anyways the hike down the kilauea iki be pretty steep and be already tire but be manageable when make down the crater didn walk all the way just admire and look around take some pics saw steam vent stay the trail and head back that point some other tourists have wander off trail and keep sing this line from freeze aurora song echo through and be get annoy tbh they wouldn stop anyways the hike be tire what work out but do and make the car that point be ish and didn want yet the kilauea overlook see the halem auma eruption because the park ranger

though be the dark night star visibility have decide drive back chain craters some star gaze but unfortunately the time drive there be start drizzle park the chain craters road wait out but the rain only get heavier that point decide head back friend be more tire more jetlagged sleep the back the car and drive back kona the entire time trail behind this car that be also leave hvnp be nice not

VisitingHawaii,camp kauai think be pretty hard get info online about how not spend hundreds dollars the different lodge options kauai hesitate bunch before move forward with our plan use only county campgrounds among other things because there aren many trip report about those there you spend days kauai and sleep county campgrounds the whole time try three them with quick tldr parenthesis salt pond beach park decent location roosters will wake you the morning somewhat windy do have bunch cockroaches bbq grill with propane tank some little stand metal box grill with fire anahola beach park tougher crowd very noisy crash wave throughout the nights someone slash our rental car gas pipe during night not recommend anini beach park definitely the best one can think negative although can recall there be shower bbqs longer write cost all only usd per night free you be resident verification saw absolutely one request see our permit despite see employees do maintenance the site moreover the only place saw people display their permit outside their tent anini for the end our trip be suppose return salt pond from anahola but decide try out anini without have the permit have the ones for salt pond and turn out fine but bear min weren high season yet this be during the month may maintenance some people show clean the bathrooms and empty the trash can that about all see closure each campground close different give day the week for deep clean do not stick around see what they actually during that moment seem like the main reason prevent homeless people from simply establish permanent camp there amenities salt pond and anini have picnic table and few street light some areas would light throughout the night can recall for anahola all three have bathrooms both salt pond and anahola have outdoor shower head that use wash ourselves anini be too big and didn stay long enough fully explore what have offer there be electrical outlets all campgrounds but didn get try them out have buy battery pack charge our electronics throughout the trip safety crowd everyone tourists and locals alike meet all campgrounds be friendly there be always legit camp tent around and some cheaper ones too salt pond and anini felt very safe the surround anahola be good foretell what be come there be some break cars that have clearly be sit there for multiple years nonetheless spend nights there and have apparent trouble until try refill our rental car return and realize someone have slash our gas pipe try siphon gas all campgrounds leave our tent all day while be away and leave bunch stuff well sleep pad sleep bag clothe toothbrush etc nothing get steal noise salt pond host big party during the weekend but aside from that only the roosters the morning be noisy noise wise anahola only the very loud crash wave be bite annoy throughout the night anini be very peaceful and nice navigation you just type the campground name and head their associate beach which will where google map send you anyways tent be easy spot and park place be obvious too food have our camp stave with salt pond have some minor amenities for you cook with fire you have bbq propane gas tank not many restaurant options around anahola some decent stuff not too far drive from salt pond more options around anini beach salt pond have little protect bay wave weren crazy and be easy swim but the water wasn very clear anahola have big wave and didn end swim around there anini have very calm beach but didn swim there either hanalei be just next door seem like be very shallow maybe not the most

VisitingHawaii,oahu big island september trip report spend one week oahu and one week the big island september here be the things like and didn like keep mind these be our opinions and you may feel differently oahu hike kuliouou ridge trail be our favorite hike with lot shade the early morning and good overlook the summit be the first hike and really like be quiet the way moana fall be mellower and shorter hike that be runner the ehukai pillbox hike take third place diamond head hike be alright too many people and shade the audio tour make more interest decide not lulumahu fall hike because the review say be muddy and challenge also decide against the lanikai pillbox hike because start late that day and there be available park glad do and instead rent full day kayak from sun and salt adventure highly recommend them and kayak the flat island and the mokes you have have vehicle and they help you load be our first time kayak the ocean and wasn challenge think would plan spend day bring food water and snorkel gear hanauma bay big rip off ticket be each and saw almost marine life while snorkel instead shark cove bring water shoe fin due the rocky bottom there book package tour kualoa ranch wasn bad but nothing write home about the package include movie site and ranch tour jungle expedition tour and aina farm tour buffet lunch be include and be subpar didn appreciate that they tell the check time be but the first tour didn start until dole plantation be alright with their overprice and not ono whip like their pineapple cut presentation didn have time check out the electric beach which local tell have good marine life but she also say prepare good swimmer have float device pearl harbor although reserve uss arizona tour they didn let because be literally minutes late not bring backpack purse get there minutes early otherwise you have wait hour longer the standby queue despite the reservation like do buy parasailing groupon and enjoy good view waikiki from the boat have docent tour iolani palace felt very rush and confuse time the docent never once ask anyone have question and most the staff didn seem very friendly stay ilikai marina which have nice view but have again pick the east side oahu due lighter traffic and the beautiful green cliffs one even order takeout from adela and eat nearby park face the cliffs food liko be average the malasadas leonard do not live the hype and get not cheaper than individual ones dinner the sea wasn bad but not worth the higher price service be great foodland poke be better than expect and freeze ahi tina poke be not worse than twice expensive fresh ahi surprisingly the mangosteens from costco and press juice be the food highlight ube cheesecake adela be good but the kinds noodle dish find get serve super greasy omelet duke waikiki that make the buffet negative experience overall didn feel the aloha spirit oahu and didn feel relax like do other islands big island the highlight be snorkel with the manta ray bring gopro go with manta ray dive hawaii and while the island discover that local costco sell person tour with kona snorkel trip have ours book months advance and decide not switch didn drink coffee our rental because the kona side have lot coffee farm that offer free estate coffee taste book tour with heavenly hawaiian and enjoy they charge small tour fee but there be other farm that not that also recommend such hula tree and greenwell sample coffee and tea buddha cup and wish have more time explore their ground kona joe farm be pleasant surprise with nice view tour big island be be another favorite buy their unique honey book morning kealakekua snorkel tour with fair wind and be another highlight the include breakfast and lunch be surprisingly tasty and the marine life that bay be the best out all main islands this spot also know captain cook bay attempt snorkel this spot another day but from the grind be only accessible hike about miles one way and instead decide the nearby manini beach glad do because well maintain with lot shade and picnic table snorkel be also good your national park pass will work uhonua honaunau national historical park aka place refuge otherwise snorkel the nearby two step beach although kealakekua be much better afterwards visit the park they show informative movie and have ranger talk plan day visit volcanoes national park and don forget your binoculars like do there be small piece active lava only visible after sundown and distance akaka fall be nice short hike but prepare pay car person drive the entire island around explore various lookouts waipio pololu etc sometimes have our convertible top down perfect for that ziplining be another must from our research although do before elsewhere wasn excite and too slow with lot wait around hours total almost for people wasn worth for the drive mauna kea be somewhat interest through the cloud but you do for stargaze have similar view the star during the drive from volcano kona like the art galleries ali drive gertrude and huggo have good live music check out their website for schedule performances food mostly eat breakfast our oceanfront rental buy starfruit and mangosteen from hilo farmer market the costco ones be better gypsea gelato and nicoco gelato be both good umeke food be too salty and you probably better off order from their adjacent market be serve fish tacos drench oil pineapples hilo gross enjoy birthday lunch bar locate inside five star resort mauna lani service be impeccable and they make feel special overall like better and felt more relax there this year didn book any restaurants like do last year kauai and maui because didn know what time would feel hungry do with our activities want something flexible for audio tour and use gypsy because shaka have fix tour use shaka maui last year and enjoy there

VisitingHawaii,visit hawaii and conflict currently ahu trip plan family start educate myself hawaii history culture ect once arrive honolulu and say the least immediately felt awful be here grow the beach own country hat when tourists would trash the beach during tourist season and usual spot would become pack understand the tourism affect aspect obviously not the historical illegal occupation part the feel native hawaiians locals and how they be feel this much larger scale than ever have tour have tour guide who be elder native hawaiian she take through the north shore oahu and every local bump into be predominantly very friendly share smile walk past each other the beach be pretty clean but any rubbish find the floor just clean the people waimea fall who be display some traditional hawaiian game and things like rope and headbands be friendly they have even visit the area near beach back home and talk about this two local girls poly samoan heritage whom purchase bracelets from have family near home and didn seem mind that be clearly tourists guess do just buy something from them but still family have make sure tip extremely generously pick rubbish off the beach walk instead clog the roads and just decent people be feel conflict about be here ask guide aunty mary about whether the locals dislike tourists turn out aunty mary grow live the area jason momoa family relatives and father and she say she contact jason after his post not visit maui she say she be angry him because hawaii need tourism and tell people not come be the wrong idea and apparently his father wasn too happy about him do that lahaina close but the rest maui and hawaii open you look jasons post you see delete this post and have make maui open post fact she arrange for one the people tour visit maui not lahaina pick her relatives and they be plan show him around she say she have take some her family children who have be affect the lahaina fire live with her oahu whilst they sort things out obviously this incredibly conflict with some native hawaiians encourage tourism and even extend such favour such show foreigners around the island out the goodness their hearts versus some say there absolutely ethical way visit hawaii particularly during the time fire lahaina maui hawaii undeniably beautiful group islands and think tourists don visit with the intention ruin the place upset the locals encourage the decline trend native hawaiian quality life such the homelessness problem think they be just uneducated and can you really blame them when the history hawaii not teach countries outside america and the travel industry social media sell hawaii the ideal vacation personally feel though once leave hawaii will be never there because leave trace rubbish shop local possible tip generously possible didn anywhere where shouldn have sacred sit local only areas stay away from wildlife and endanger flora and just mainly educate myself hawaii history and culture now will come back hawaii probably not despite what aunty mary have tell that she fact want tourism and happy for come back her island probably largely due the fact that many hawaiians like herself work the tourism industry because they don really have many other choices really sharp double edge sword because there will always bad tourists despite there be good tourists and there will always positives and negative everything think possible for tourists visit hawaii and respectful and leave they be never there whilst appreciate the culture and aesthetics the land yes but the tourism industry full fault like use precious fresh water take land that could use for home create road traffic increase the property cost live price allow affluent properties build and develop and many other things yes this whole issue boil directly down the fact that things aren the way they should use and that make really difficult solve because the illegal occupation hawaii can never reverse hopefully can amend but you can turn back time and make not happen the first place leave hawaii now definitely more educate individual who extremely grateful have be treat nicely and saw some incredibly beautiful place but also very conflict individual because this issue surround hawaii have never ever be bring home country anyone anywhere until research myself would love hear people thoughts this and their experience mahalo

transport and right out the gate be confuse there be heathrow express and heathrow local run the same track the local train that make numerous stop before reach the end the line and take much longer there human try direct travellers into the right train but that only go far listen and look and don afraid ask watch husband and wife come the wife hop onto the train the husband hesitate and ask bystander this be the express the train doors close with his wife the local and leave be pound the doors assume they never see each other again lol underground not buy oyster card they be not neccessary contactless payment accept all station use our phone everywhere take the time familiarize yourself with the underground station be name not number multiple line run the same station the name the train didn always make sense but once understand that the last stop the line be list the train have easier time know which direction be head also be very quiet the train cash exchange dollars go atm not necessary use contactless payment everywhere specifically our phone unlike the usa where some place just don use apple pay and contactless be universal hotel stay travelodge minutes from the algate underground stop about night walk the tower bridge minutes super convenient when look for hotels there be deal but try find hotel near transit near things you want rental cars rent car thru budget not too expensive most rentals be manual transmission aware you need automatic they do not take our international license just our state drivers license they drive the leave side the road the but its pretty easy get use just find wife and rid the shoulder curb lot drive stonehenge and bath totally worth for both walk walk nearly everywhere since they drive the other side you must mindful when cross streets you notice look right mark the road reminders just careful for pedestrians its chaos out there feel like the all pretty much walk the right drive the right walk the right right when enter exit the underground there be mark remind you walk down the leave set stairs drive the leave walk the leave right wrong once you get the sidewalks free for all all day just come passersby

brick lane be disappoint but there be good stuff find enjoy afternoon tea the woseley and per person good deal dishoom soho be great might need reservation the fish portion fish chip be typically good borough market must do full english breakfast there maria and eat raclette kappacasein good cafe nata have awesome porteguese tarts sunday roast blacklock be okay note you be fan tikka masala the version entirely different beast not creamy and veryyy sweet service felt like there be certain for lack better word shyness with customer service generally very friendly but kind indifferent especially with servers restaurants you greet and show table with menu may take while for the server come back and take your order the food be freshly make everywhere problems there there check while you eat ice straw with drink when you be finish you will need flag down your server and ask for the bill they will bring the check but may not come back for while take payment just patient and friendly again everyone seem very nice though also saturday be very busy everywhere many things be close sundays the sight sit all the famous sight be totally worth see house parliament tower bridge stonehenge etc be quite amaze behold can think anywhere the that felt like europe take citycruise down the thames which allow for nice angle pics many famous london architechture go championship level football match which be fun safety not once do feel unsafe fact the city be impeccably clean the underground be spotless homeless beg scam originally from be stun how sterile london felt but not bad way eurostar take the high speed train paris out pancras london real easy get take less than minutes get through passport control you not need any covid relate documentation passport agent check your passport then you wait board your train clean comfortable fast our ticket be less than each paris eurostar arrive gare nord this north the center paris the arrondissement right near famous montmarte you exit your train and you be paris nothing declare checkpoints anything through hotel stay awesome little hotel the hotel darcet under night be minutes from the place clichy metro station minutes walk from gare nord walk past montmarte the famous moulin rouge and sacre coeur the family there speak fluent english however they ask want comminicate french do little bite both patient and friendly language fact find the people paris patient and friendly all the way around especially you try speak french with them do perhaps days duolinguo coffee break french podcast the car learn french with alexa youtube can pronounce and form simple sentence especially when order food lol but can really struggle with understand french speak for example gal the hotel would speak slowly which help immensely but would help english she saw confuse servers be the same all bonjour une table pour deux vous plait and they might come back with some speedy french and didn catch they repeat english typically try order use french and try they light giggle compliment pronunciation be pleasant still say parisiens speak good english transport the metro can seemingly get you anywhere you can use contactless payment like your phone you have puchase ticket navigo card the metro clean and probably tad bite easier understand than the london underground however the train get pack very small train with less cars than most mass transit systems bike lanes be everywhere rent lime and tier foot scooters for the first time and felt super comfortable go all over the city with them finally have read that taxis the airports be price contolled euros take taxi orly and be fact euros smoke boy the french like smoke walk down the street stand line restaurant sit the bistro you be sensitive smoke you may wish sit inside cafes and bistros cash again use contactless payments everywhere do not use cash once this trip sight what beautiful city the architechture amaze the arc triomphe eiffel tower sacre coeur invalid pont alexandre the louvre versailles only about minutes away train all worth you the louvre have plan pack with art and people and kind chaotic the food amaze there be boulangeries

salt butter delicious there road rue montparnasse that strictly restaurants that serve crepe and their savory cousin the galette safety totally safe there be some homeless beg go and people try get you sign petition but even walk the streets night be fun and excite and not dangerous intimidate all get back home take taxi orly try uber first but they cancel repeatedly honestly euros why not take taxi get back into the you must have negative covid test within hours your flight not what do which online covid test with virtual doctor the attendant check do not accept that result have rush the

Europetravel,cultural peculiarities from north american who just finish alps road trip greet grow canada and have also spend time live australia and the unite state recently finish trip where go europe for the first time road trip the alps include france italy germany austria and switzerland overall be such great experience and absolutely gorgeous continent want point out some cultural oddities that think be peculiar interest differences contrast how things be do north america drive notice that many the major motorways europe require toll fee first be disgust have pay every time go the motorway because simply not use do that virtually all motorways north america be free but later realize this actually make lot sense because much more common europe not own car and therefore those pay for the roads be those actually use the roads more this also get tourists who use the roads lot while vacation help pay for the roads well help prevent the major motorways from get too congest the for example all the interstate highways be free and pay for through federal tax but tourists end pay nothing use the roads since they don pay american income tax europe actually seem have logical system here roundabouts love them cringe go back the and have deal with endless traffic light don know whose idea be over here barely use roundabouts but can say after use them extensively europe this trip that they be objectively smoother and better than traffic light for moderate heavy traffic intersections severe lack park and always pay park even smaller towns and suburbs guess come with the territory have lot higher population density and encourage people use more environmentally friendly mean transport get but still find this very frustrate compare the where unless you be downtown city there always ample free park speed limit be usually very generous europe often motorways which nice canada for example there be speed limit higher than even straight highways through rural area incredibly restrictive the point absurdity also police patrol for speeders much more canada and the do not see cop hide around corner wait catch speeders europe like commonly north america road sign seem not user friendly and don think language barrier for example germany numerous time while the motorway look for specific exit only see sign that simply say ausfahrt but do not provide any further label which exit where go other time there sign that list different streets locations that the exit go very small font that impossible read until you get close make impossible read and make decision before pass the sign and the exit very frustrate and definitely miss numerous exit because these quirk bathrooms couldn help but notice incredible lack public bathrooms and those that exist often charge money for use find this kind astonish consider basic human function that cannot stop and somewhat cruel basically say you have piss yourself you don have change you pay the bathroom toll numerous time struggle find bathroom stop while drive road trip the super easy find bathrooms because every single gas station have convenience store attach with public bathrooms notice europe many gas station pump not have convenience store bathrooms then try stop grocery store and be tell there be public bathrooms there either where exactly be people suppose usually restaurants want you make purchase use the bathroom have never life see bathroom that charge fee for use north america this be very interest restaurants love that the advertise price already include all tax and the final price you pay much more consumer friendly the the price the menu do not include tax and also you be expect tip which will drive the final price often above what the menu price state once you factor these tip culture the incredibly toxic and exploitative and appreciate that there isn this kind pressure europe the table service receive do not seem suffer all despite there be tip great din experience overall europeans love charge for water this isn thing north america you can get free water any restaurant be confuse the first time ask for tap water and be tell they don serve tap water only still sparkle didn even know what still water never hear that term before north american restaurants still water just call water and sparkle water isn really thing do exist here but very niche and typically most people not drink sparkle water and many restaurants not offer the menu alcohol dirt cheap be shock that italy wine be the same price water and germany beer be the same price water get glass wine restaurant for euros be shock the you will struggle find restaurant that will serve you glass wine for less than usd which vritually double the price and then you must tip top that hotels the first hotel check into europe call the front desk angrily exclaim that none the light be work the room the desk clerk sigh another stupid american and explain that you must put the hotel room key the slot the door activate the power this blow mind there be hotels north america where have see this make sense though try and limit waste electricity guests tend not care about waste electricity they aren pay the electric bill kind smart idea maybe be just the fact be the mountains where isn suppose get too hot but basically every hotel stay lack air condition have air condition the thermostat be lock that the temperature could not adjust this often make sleep very uncomfortable first assume be save power but mind bogglingly most hotels have the heat crank even cold nights and would not let you turn the temperature down waste heat electricity unnecessarily be outside and inside room and could not adjust the temperature most hotels end sleep with the windows and balcony door wide open cool off the room because all hotels have the heat crank much be stifle have never see hotel north america where the guest could not adjust the climate control for the room this be again very new and somewhat uncomfortable surprise architecture european towns be beautiful compare their american counterparts such timeless and quaint architecture most small towns come across even the less touristy ones america most small towns be incredibly drab and anemic lack character and essentially they look like shit compare the beautiful style and architecture european towns the streets be also keep much cleaner europe than typical city town comparable size which be very nice anyways this get very long now love the alps love the european food and love the friendly conversation strike with many hikers come across travel you guy have beautiful homeland and definitely wish visit again the future that all
