transport and right out the gate be confuse there be heathrow express and heathrow local run the same track the local train that make numerous stop before reach the end the line and take much longer there human try direct travellers into the right train but that only go far listen and look and don afraid ask watch husband and wife come the wife hop onto the train the husband hesitate and ask bystander this be the express the train doors close with his wife the local and leave be pound the doors assume they never see each other again lol underground not buy oyster card they be not neccessary contactless payment accept all station use our phone everywhere take the time familiarize yourself with the underground station be name not number multiple line run the same station the name the train didn always make sense but once understand that the last stop the line be list the train have easier time know which direction be head also be very quiet the train cash exchange dollars go atm not necessary use contactless payment everywhere specifically our phone unlike the usa where some place just don use apple pay and contactless be universal hotel stay travelodge minutes from the algate underground stop about night walk the tower bridge minutes super convenient when look for hotels there be deal but try find hotel near transit near things you want rental cars rent car thru budget not too expensive most rentals be manual transmission aware you need automatic they do not take our international license just our state drivers license they drive the leave side the road the but its pretty easy get use just find wife and rid the shoulder curb lot drive stonehenge and bath totally worth for both walk walk nearly everywhere since they drive the other side you must mindful when cross streets you notice look right mark the road reminders just careful for pedestrians its chaos out there feel like the all pretty much walk the right drive the right walk the right right when enter exit the underground there be mark remind you walk down the leave set stairs drive the leave walk the leave right wrong once you get the sidewalks free for all all day just come passersby

brick lane be disappoint but there be good stuff find enjoy afternoon tea the woseley and per person good deal dishoom soho be great might need reservation the fish portion fish chip be typically good borough market must do full english breakfast there maria and eat raclette kappacasein good cafe nata have awesome porteguese tarts sunday roast blacklock be okay note you be fan tikka masala the version entirely different beast not creamy and veryyy sweet service felt like there be certain for lack better word shyness with customer service generally very friendly but kind indifferent especially with servers restaurants you greet and show table with menu may take while for the server come back and take your order the food be freshly make everywhere problems there there check while you eat ice straw with drink when you be finish you will need flag down your server and ask for the bill they will bring the check but may not come back for while take payment just patient and friendly again everyone seem very nice though also saturday be very busy everywhere many things be close sundays the sight sit all the famous sight be totally worth see house parliament tower bridge stonehenge etc be quite amaze behold can think anywhere the that felt like europe take citycruise down the thames which allow for nice angle pics many famous london architechture go championship level football match which be fun safety not once do feel unsafe fact the city be impeccably clean the underground be spotless homeless beg scam originally from be stun how sterile london felt but not bad way eurostar take the high speed train paris out pancras london real easy get take less than minutes get through passport control you not need any covid relate documentation passport agent check your passport then you wait board your train clean comfortable fast our ticket be less than each paris eurostar arrive gare nord this north the center paris the arrondissement right near famous montmarte you exit your train and you be paris nothing declare checkpoints anything through hotel stay awesome little hotel the hotel darcet under night be minutes from the place clichy metro station minutes walk from gare nord walk past montmarte the famous moulin rouge and sacre coeur the family there speak fluent english however they ask want comminicate french do little bite both patient and friendly language fact find the people paris patient and friendly all the way around especially you try speak french with them do perhaps days duolinguo coffee break french podcast the car learn french with alexa youtube can pronounce and form simple sentence especially when order food lol but can really struggle with understand french speak for example gal the hotel would speak slowly which help immensely but would help english she saw confuse servers be the same all bonjour une table pour deux vous plait and they might come back with some speedy french and didn catch they repeat english typically try order use french and try they light giggle compliment pronunciation be pleasant still say parisiens speak good english transport the metro can seemingly get you anywhere you can use contactless payment like your phone you have puchase ticket navigo card the metro clean and probably tad bite easier understand than the london underground however the train get pack very small train with less cars than most mass transit systems bike lanes be everywhere rent lime and tier foot scooters for the first time and felt super comfortable go all over the city with them finally have read that taxis the airports be price contolled euros take taxi orly and be fact euros smoke boy the french like smoke walk down the street stand line restaurant sit the bistro you be sensitive smoke you may wish sit inside cafes and bistros cash again use contactless payments everywhere do not use cash once this trip sight what beautiful city the architechture amaze the arc triomphe eiffel tower sacre coeur invalid pont alexandre the louvre versailles only about minutes away train all worth you the louvre have plan pack with art and people and kind chaotic the food amaze there be boulangeries

salt butter delicious there road rue montparnasse that strictly restaurants that serve crepe and their savory cousin the galette safety totally safe there be some homeless beg go and people try get you sign petition but even walk the streets night be fun and excite and not dangerous intimidate all get back home take taxi orly try uber first but they cancel repeatedly honestly euros why not take taxi get back into the you must have negative covid test within hours your flight not what do which online covid test with virtual doctor the attendant check do not accept that result have rush the

Europetravel,cultural peculiarities from north american who just finish alps road trip greet grow canada and have also spend time live australia and the unite state recently finish trip where go europe for the first time road trip the alps include france italy germany austria and switzerland overall be such great experience and absolutely gorgeous continent want point out some cultural oddities that think be peculiar interest differences contrast how things be do north america drive notice that many the major motorways europe require toll fee first be disgust have pay every time go the motorway because simply not use do that virtually all motorways north america be free but later realize this actually make lot sense because much more common europe not own car and therefore those pay for the roads be those actually use the roads more this also get tourists who use the roads lot while vacation help pay for the roads well help prevent the major motorways from get too congest the for example all the interstate highways be free and pay for through federal tax but tourists end pay nothing use the roads since they don pay american income tax europe actually seem have logical system here roundabouts love them cringe go back the and have deal with endless traffic light don know whose idea be over here barely use roundabouts but can say after use them extensively europe this trip that they be objectively smoother and better than traffic light for moderate heavy traffic intersections severe lack park and always pay park even smaller towns and suburbs guess come with the territory have lot higher population density and encourage people use more environmentally friendly mean transport get but still find this very frustrate compare the where unless you be downtown city there always ample free park speed limit be usually very generous europe often motorways which nice canada for example there be speed limit higher than even straight highways through rural area incredibly restrictive the point absurdity also police patrol for speeders much more canada and the do not see cop hide around corner wait catch speeders europe like commonly north america road sign seem not user friendly and don think language barrier for example germany numerous time while the motorway look for specific exit only see sign that simply say ausfahrt but do not provide any further label which exit where go other time there sign that list different streets locations that the exit go very small font that impossible read until you get close make impossible read and make decision before pass the sign and the exit very frustrate and definitely miss numerous exit because these quirk bathrooms couldn help but notice incredible lack public bathrooms and those that exist often charge money for use find this kind astonish consider basic human function that cannot stop and somewhat cruel basically say you have piss yourself you don have change you pay the bathroom toll numerous time struggle find bathroom stop while drive road trip the super easy find bathrooms because every single gas station have convenience store attach with public bathrooms notice europe many gas station pump not have convenience store bathrooms then try stop grocery store and be tell there be public bathrooms there either where exactly be people suppose usually restaurants want you make purchase use the bathroom have never life see bathroom that charge fee for use north america this be very interest restaurants love that the advertise price already include all tax and the final price you pay much more consumer friendly the the price the menu do not include tax and also you be expect tip which will drive the final price often above what the menu price state once you factor these tip culture the incredibly toxic and exploitative and appreciate that there isn this kind pressure europe the table service receive do not seem suffer all despite there be tip great din experience overall europeans love charge for water this isn thing north america you can get free water any restaurant be confuse the first time ask for tap water and be tell they don serve tap water only still sparkle didn even know what still water never hear that term before north american restaurants still water just call water and sparkle water isn really thing do exist here but very niche and typically most people not drink sparkle water and many restaurants not offer the menu alcohol dirt cheap be shock that italy wine be the same price water and germany beer be the same price water get glass wine restaurant for euros be shock the you will struggle find restaurant that will serve you glass wine for less than usd which vritually double the price and then you must tip top that hotels the first hotel check into europe call the front desk angrily exclaim that none the light be work the room the desk clerk sigh another stupid american and explain that you must put the hotel room key the slot the door activate the power this blow mind there be hotels north america where have see this make sense though try and limit waste electricity guests tend not care about waste electricity they aren pay the electric bill kind smart idea maybe be just the fact be the mountains where isn suppose get too hot but basically every hotel stay lack air condition have air condition the thermostat be lock that the temperature could not adjust this often make sleep very uncomfortable first assume be save power but mind bogglingly most hotels have the heat crank even cold nights and would not let you turn the temperature down waste heat electricity unnecessarily be outside and inside room and could not adjust the temperature most hotels end sleep with the windows and balcony door wide open cool off the room because all hotels have the heat crank much be stifle have never see hotel north america where the guest could not adjust the climate control for the room this be again very new and somewhat uncomfortable surprise architecture european towns be beautiful compare their american counterparts such timeless and quaint architecture most small towns come across even the less touristy ones america most small towns be incredibly drab and anemic lack character and essentially they look like shit compare the beautiful style and architecture european towns the streets be also keep much cleaner europe than typical city town comparable size which be very nice anyways this get very long now love the alps love the european food and love the friendly conversation strike with many hikers come across travel you guy have beautiful homeland and definitely wish visit again the future that all
