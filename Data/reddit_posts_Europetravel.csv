1709523519.0,Safety precautions for Asian first-timers,"Hi all, my partner and I are thinking of visiting Europe, as it's one of our dream destinations. In preparation, and because this will be our first time ever going to Europe, I also want to ensure that we can travel safely and worry-free of any crimes while we're there. Apologies for the totally newbie questions.

More context if that helps: We're both Asian (look obviously Asian too), and have ever lived in Asia. Edit: South East Asians living in East Asia. We speak English primarily though. We're thinking of going to Rome, Venice, Versailles and maybe Frankfurt.

My general questions would be:

1. How much cash should we bring on our bodies for emergency, or better with no cash at all?
2. How should we conduct ourselves in public (talking, walking, body language, clothes, etc) to not attract unwanted/negative attention?
3. What would you recommend us specifically to avoid? (activity, service, goods, place, etc)

Thanks in advance!",Europetravel

Neither of us have been there before. We are just in the planning phase right now and looking for recommendations for your favorite cities/areas!

We’re thinking about 4 cities with 2-3 nights in each place (Nice being the 4th stop due to our early return home flight time). If you could visit any 4 places in this entire region, which cities would you go to??

We love the water (who doesn’t?), the mountains, hiking, architecture, medieval sights, gardens, relaxing, good food, etc. Neither of us are into wine, but thinking there’s more to France than just that!

We are open to renting a car or traveling by train (or even grabbing a quick flight if we decide to go far into Italy!).

I’d love to know your ideal trip if this was your vacation! We don’t have the option to extend our trip, unfortunately. Thanks!!!

I hope you're well. I just came out of a 4 year relationship, based in London, and I'm looking for some reccomendations as to where I could go in late May four 4 nights or so in Europe.

I'm not looking for a party scene, but am big on history, museums, art galleries, culture, architecture and good food. I love zoos and aquariums, I like a good walking tour and somewhere I can walk all over.

I'd like to go somewhere new, which is easily accessible from the airport (taxi/shuttle etc).

I've been already all over France, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Porto, Madeira, Oslo, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Greece, Bucharest, Sofia, Kiev etc.

I'm think about perhaps somewhere in Germany, Poland, Morocco, Helsinki, Tallin, but I really would appreciate tips and suggestions from others. ",Europetravel

1709487949.0,Eating well and staying healthy while traveling,"Hi! I just took my first vacation in for-ev-er, since the pandemic, and traveled to southern Spain and Portugal for 10 days this February. I had a wonderful time and want to return next year to see more of Spain, particularly. But there is one aspect of the trip I'd like to do better on next time: eating well.

I am not strictly kosher but do not consume pork or shellfish, so I found it tough to order food at restaurants sometimes. I'd often end up with a burger and fries; not so great! And I felt that restaurant food two or three times a day wasn't so healthy. I would often stop by a pastry shop in the morning, and in general, did not eat nearly as many fruits and vegetables as I'm used to at home, and by the end of the trip I wasn't feeling so good. In fact I did a long bike ride on the last day and ended up getting dangerously dehydrated through my own inattention to consuming enough water, but I also think it was carryover from not eating whole foods throughout the vacation.

How do you handle things when you travel to stay healthy? My vacations are solo, and I'm traveling fairly light and using public transportation rather than a car. I use airBNBs or hotels (not hostels). I feel like I should have done so much better, but I was so focused on what to do and see that I didn't handle the food aspect of it very well. ",Europetravel
1709521826.0,1 wk in Basque Country ending the trip in Pamplona for the running of the bulls.,"We have 1 week to explore the Basque Country and end our trip in Pamplona for the San Fermin festival (midweek). 
Asking for advice on transportation-buses or trains?
Should we have a base somewhere and do day trips? 
Which towns do you recommend or itinerary? 
Do we pop over to the French side? 
We won’t have a car, just interested in sightseeing, food, and appreciating the culture. 
Obviously this is in July, we are aware it is peak tourist season but this is what we’re stuck with so. We’re okay skipping beaches if they’re too crowded. We prefer mountains (any hikes you recommend?) over beaches but if there’s a beach that’s absolutely worth it then we would love to try it out. 

Also, trying to solidify our plan for the San Fermin festival/Bull run. No one will be running, just watching from a balcony. Is Pamplona worth sightseeing DURING the festival, though, since it will be crowded? Do we stay just the one night or should we do two? This will be mid week. I realize it’s 4 months away, we just decided this today lol. There are still hotels available but need to make a decision asap. 

And would appreciate anything else I’m not thinking of.

I mainly want to visit Paris, Venice, Florence, and Rome this time, but since Brussels and Amsterdam are not very far from Paris, I thought I could maybe take a detour for one or two days. So I roughly planned two routes, and I wish to hear what you guys think of these. (Overall I want to keep the trip under 12 days, but my budget is pretty flexible)

&#x200B;

1. Land in Paris, hangout for 2 or 3 days, then take train to brussels (no overnight stay) and then to amsterdam. Then take train to Venice (don't even sure if they have a train to Venice from Amsterdam), then to Florence and finally Rome.
2. Land in Paris, hangout for 2 or 3 days, then take train stright from Paris to Venice, then to Florence and finally Rome.

It is really my early stage of planning, so if you guys went through a simillar travel route, could you also share with me your experience?",Europetravel

I have the chance to take my kids, ages 15 and 12, to Europe for a few weeks this summer. It would be between mid-June and late July.

I know that this is prime tourist season and there will be crowds, so I'm looking for some lesser known locations. I'm planning that we'll move around a bit, possibly spending a longer time in one low-key place in the middle of the trip. I've been to Europe many times but my kids have never left the US. They are seasoned travelers though. 

We love cities, museums, historical stuff. We also love outdoor stuff - Beaches, hiking, biking, kayaking. I'd like to do a mix of these types of locations.

Flying in to Venice, flying out of Zurich. The plan was to do Northern Italy and hit some spots in Switzerland before flying back home.

Keep flipping back and forth on what to do in-between. **We have decided that one day on the ground in Venice is more than enough for us.** We have zero interest in spending any longer in Venice. So we will land, have a full day on the ground, stay in Venice night one, and then leave the morning of day 2.

Originally we planned on hitting Bologna, Florence and Milan as well. We 86'd Bologna and had decided on 2 days in Florence and a day in Milan.

Then we started talking about hitting Cinque Terre. But then we started talking about hitting the Dolomites. So we are now on the fence of which direction to take this.

We could do Venice>Florence>Cinque Terre>Milan and then head to Switzerland

Or, we could do Venice>Dolomites then head to Innsbruck, Austria, and then proceed to Switzerland. Maybe Liechtenstein in between?

On the Switzerland side of things we have less plans/thoughts. We've flagged Bern, Lucerne, Interlaken, Basel, Zermatt, and Grindlewald as possible spots to hit. We plan to hit Zurich last as that is where we are flying out of and really only want a night there.

We are planning to train between cities. Open to renting a car but one way drop fees and crossing borders makes that a bit excessive in cost.

Day 1 - Arrive in Venice - Spend day in Venice

Day 2 - Leave Venice for TBD Location

1709142341.0,Montpellier to Barcelona by train -- help with logistics,"We would like to return our rental car in Montpellier, then board a train for Barcelona. Can someone pls help me with the following questions:
1. Is thetrainline.com the best way to buy the train tickets?
2. Is the train departing Gare de Montpellier Saint-Roch and arriving at Barcelona Sants (3 hr journey) the correct one to take? Or should I be looking at other stations. One of our aims in choosing stations is for ease of rental car return (Montpellier) and rental car pick up (Barcelona).
3. Am I correct in assuming that Renfe tickets are non-refundable (if buying the cheapest ones). And we just print and bring the tickets when boarding the train.

*Best time to travel?*
We are the sort that enjoy walking everywhere and travel slightly slower to appreciate local culture and everyday life in the cities we are visiting. We read that September is the best time to go, but I’m very hesitant to miss the birthday of my elderly mother. Is October a recommended month to go? Ideally, we hope to go when it’s slightly less crowded with little rainfall. For folks who have been - will Nov be too chilly to be walking everywhere? 

*Area to stay in Porto?*
Apart from the above, will appreciate recommended areas to stay in Porto too! After some research, we will likely stay in the Chiado area when in Lisbon, as it seems not too far from the main city center/tourist sights, yet situated in a quaint and less chaotic area, with food and shops within walking distance. If anyone knows a neighbourhood in Porto that fits this description, please shout! 

*Madeira* 
Any suggested itinerary for Madeira (4 days) would be much appreciated too, though I’d probably drop this question in the Madeira thread! 

*Airbnb or hotel* 
Last but not least - hotel or Airbnb for Portugal? Our budget is around 100 per night, and we found some beautiful Airbnb… but will appreciate any insight here.

First time travelling solo in Europe for a week the end of August. I'm flying into Amsterdam as flights from Canada are super expensive to other closer cities. 

Here's my itinerary: land in Amsterdam in the morning, spend the day there, then catch the night train to Munich. 2 nights in Munich with a day trip to Fussen to see Neuschwanstein Castle. Bus to Salzburg, spend 1 night there (I'm a big sound of music fan!). Bus to Lake Bled, spend 2 nights there then 1 night in Ljubljana. Fly back to Amsterdam from Ljubljana and then back to Canada!

Is this unreasonable for a week? For such a short trip, I'm worried that the night train to Munich may be a real pain and it may be worthwhile to connect to another flight through Amsterdam or pay extra just to fly directly to Munich. 

If this route is somewhat unreasonable for a week - I'd love suggestions on other, more compact routes which may be easier to fit into a week. From my home airport, the cheapest flights are into Dublin, Paris CDG, Toulouse, Amsterdam, and Lisbon. I'd prefer somewhere on the budget-friendly side (I'm a student), and I love outdoor activities as well as museums. I've considered doing the south of France (Toulouse to Nice) but was concerned it would be too hot and too crowded.

I think it’s important to note that we ***like*** fast-paced trips and ***like*** road-tripping other countries. Last summer we road-tripped Ireland and did 11 nights in 11 different B&Bs. It was such an amazing way to see the countryside and we both agreed that we like that “style” of itinerary (while we’re young without kids, at least!). So I’m sure this isn’t everyone’s “cup of tea,” but please know that we’ve tested this out before and we’re ready to do it again :) My husband prefers nature/country over cities so when we do visit cities, we like to see the major sites in about a day and then get out to do more hiking/countryside/etc

Also to know: we are meeting up with our friends in Marseille at the end of the trip, and I’d like to get there in as direct of a way as possible. I put Munich at the end of the trip because there are \*direct\* flights to Marseille. I originally had this trip going in reverse (Berlin - Prague - Austria - Munich - Switzerland) and then taking a train to Marseille from Switzerland. So the itinerary could definitely be done in a different order, but I’d like to get to Marseille easily! Also, I originally had us flying into Berlin because there is a cheap direct Norse flight out of NYC but I found a decently priced direct one into Zurich instead. We then cut Berlin from the itinerary to give us more time elsewhere! The dates are slightly flexible, but pretty much set based on working backward from meeting up with our friends. 

**Draft Itinerary So Far:** 

Day 1 - Land in Zurich at 9am, explore Zurich 

Day 2 - Train to Lucerne - Lucerne exploring/nature 

Day 3 - Lucerne sites in the morning - Afternoon train from Lucerne to somewhere in/near the Western part of Austria (such a Bregenz) that is a taxi ride away from Dornbirn 

Day 4 - Rent a car in Dornbirn (Austria\*) - drive to Neuschwanstein Castle - Hike somewhere - drive to stay in/near Garmisch 

Day 5 - Drive to Salzburg to see some major sites - end the day in Wachau Valley (somewhere like Durnstein) 

Day 6 - Wachau valley (hiking / biking) 

Day 7 - Wachau valley (wineries / do laundry) 

Day 8 - Drive to Vienna to see some major sites, drop off the car in Vienna - take a train in the evening to Prague 

Day 9 - Day in Prague 

Day 10 - Take a train to Pilzen, explore and stay there 

Day 11 - Take a bus to Nuremberg, see WWII sites there 

Day 12 - Take a train to Dachau, then train to Munich to stay 

Day 13 - Munich site-seeing 

Day 14 - Afternoon flight to Marseille 

\*Basing the end of Day 3 off of trying to get to Austria to rent a car. It seems there are exorbitant fees to rent in Switzerland, drop off in Austria (Like 2x to 2.5x the price!) The western-most car rental place I could find in Austria was in Dornbirn. Am I making this too complicated? Should I just rent the car in Lucerne? 

I thought it would be best to put the “slowest” part of the itinerary in the middle of the trip and stay a few days in the Wachau valley - we’d like to wake up and have breakfast on the river, bike along the river, do some light hiking, visit small towns, visit wineries, etc. I figured Wachau would make it easier to get to Vienna vs staying in the Lake District.

But since then I've gotten at least 3 separate ""tickets"" in the mail. One I remember, parking where I definitely was not supposed to in Rome. Ok. I paid that. The second infraction was highly likely; speeding. I have been known to go fast. Ok, I paid that, too.

Today I get yet another ticket. This has been over two years mind you. This is from Florence and is either a parking ticket or entry into a special area ticket, either of which I could easily be guilty of as I do not read Italian street signs very well. 

It's starting to feel like some scammer has a live one and they're milking me for a couple bucks (€300!) every few months. It could really be lucrative over the long term if you think about it. Is this a thing? Anybody heard of such scam? ",Europetravel
1709032453.0,How much cash should I exchange and carry beforehand? (Spain & Portugal) ,"Hi all! I’ve an upcoming trip from India to Spain & Portugal (duration - 2 weeks). Cities - Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Algarve, Porto, Lisbon.

1. Hostels - almost all of my hostels booked are pay-at-property type, and they are pretty popular tourist hostels so I hope card payment will be accepted there as well?

I'm planning a trip from Madrid to Seville and then flying back to Barcelona. I've got two options in mind and would love some advice:

Option 1: Renting a car - Pick up in Madrid, drop off in Seville.

Option 2: Taking the train - Exploring the route by train.

I've listed some cities and places I want to visit along the way in the image attached.

What are your thoughts on renting a car versus taking the train, considering luggage safety?

Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated. Has anyone tried a similar route? Looking forward to your travel wisdom!

Thanks a bunch!

03/07/24: Munich - Fly back home.

  
As a background, I am quite a fast traveller and prefer to walk and explore instead of spending hours at the same place. I'm also OK if I miss some churches or museums as that's not really my cup of tea. That's why I decide to spend 2 full days for exploring the city and just use the other day for day trips. I also rely 100% on public transports, so I can only consider destinations that are reasonably reachable only using public transports.

  
For my day trips in Prague and Budapest, what do you think is the best combination for me, in terms of time and cost efficiency + diversity, given my overall itinerary? I'm still contemplating on what to do for the day trips.

  
Also, is there any city that you think I spent the time too much and it's better for me to be allocated to other cities?

I plan to visit some universities I plan to apply to and travel Europe by train this summer. I recently turned 18 so this will be my first real solo trip, though I might bring a friend too. I'm an artist, so expect a lot of art related destinations lol. I have some questions at the end


Here is my travel plan so far:


June 30 - Arrival to Amsterdam by plane, visit Vondelpark and Van Gogh Museum

July 1 - Visit ARTZUID and Gerrit Rietweld Art Academie before noon, Anne Frank House and Red Light Secrets Museum in the afternoon

July 2 - I dedicated this whole day to Rijks Museum and the gardens

July 3 - Wake up early, take a train to The Hague, visit Royal Academy of Arts and maybe Mauritshuis if I can find the time. I plan to leave before 18:00 to take a train to Rotterdam

July 4 - Visit Willem de Koonig Academy before noon, Marithiem Museum in the afternoon and the Markthal for dinner

July 5 - Visit Rotterdam Zoo & do some live sketching

July 6 - Wake up early, take a train to Eindhoven, visit Design Academy Eindhoven and Van Abbe Museum. Then take a train to Bruge, Belgium

July 7 - Walk around Bruge, sightseeing of The Markt and old areas. Maybe take an evening history tour. Visit the Beer Museum

July 8 - Visiting Basilica of the Holy Blood, Belfort, and some other cathedrals. Drawing / sketching studies of the buildings.

July 9 - Ten Wijngarde & Minnewater park, and then get some waffles. Take a train to Paris in the evening, sleeping on the train that night.

July 10 - Visit Notre Dame in the morning, and the Natural History & Evolution museums afterwards.

July 11 - Get a croissant, a coffee, and eat in the grassy areas around Eiffel. Then visit the Paris Aquarium and Museum d'Orsay.

July 12 - Climb Arc de Triomphe & visit the Petit Paleis before going to Louvre. Might visit the Gobelins Art Academy if I have time left.

July 13 - Museum De Oranjerie before noon & Centre Pompidou (Modern Art) afterwards

July 14 - Place du Tertre & Sacre Coeur before noon, and then meet up with another friend to see the fireworks that night

July 15 - Leave by plane from Paris



Alright, now some questions!

1 - Where can I find the cheapest hostels? Talking just a bed, like a dorm. Willing to stay with multiple people, I don't mind, but has to be close to the city center & safe.

2 - Would getting an Interrail ticket be fitting for this travel plan? Or should I go with something else?

3 - Are there any museum passes that would be useful for me?

4 - For using the metro, should I download the respective apps for each city?

I'm planning a two-week family trip with 7 members (4 seniors, 2 adults, and a toddler) to Spain and Switzerland in August last week. I have to stay in Spain for a week for work and then we are flexible with second option but prefer Switzerland. I have a few questions:

1. **Outdoor and Nature Spot Recommendations**: We prefer outdoor and nature spots over cities and enjoy moderate temperatures. Considering our preferences, do you have any recommendations for places to visit in Spain and Switzerland? Do you recommend any other place apart from Switzerland which could more convenient but as beautiful? We're flexible and open to suggestions.

2. **Car Rental with US (California) License**: As someone from an East Asian country holding a US (California) driving license, am I allowed to rent a car in Spain or Switzerland? Any specific requirements I should be aware of?

3. **Recommended Mode of Transport**: Given our family size and composition (4 seniors, 2 adults, and a toddler), what mode of transport would you recommend for traveling within and between Spain and Switzerland? We’re considering all options including renting cars, using trains or buses, or possibly hiring a driver for more convenience. How much does hiring a driver cost?

I have a close friend who is like family who NEVER travels whose brother is getting married mid-June in Balatonvilágos, Hungary. Long story short, I'll be accompanying her (with my, who will then be 14 years old, daughter) to help her get there and back, but also explore while we are there.  
We plan to arrive to Budapest around June 14 and head straight to Balatonvilágos. The wedding is the 16th so we will go back to Budapest and explore a few days. What should we do?  


Is Croatia a good stop after that? Any advice on how to get to some destinations after Hungary? Bus? Plane? Other? I am open to other places as well.  


We will be in London the last few days which is where her brother lives. So we also need to get there from whatever place(s) we visit after Hungary.

  
I am so overwhelmed by the research. Will we need to apply for visas? Is it best to use my credit card or just take cash and get local currency? We have not booked a single thing besides the hotel where the wedding will be.

  
Any advice on how to get to and from Europe from the US without breaking the bank? We are budget travelers so one backpack is all we will take.

  
Happy to connect and hang out if anyone will be anywhere we will be!

What do u think is a best solution (cost effective, time, safety, comfort) - to rent a car and sleep every night in different hotel (we'll need to do check-in, check-out every single day as well as to lookup for hotel) or to rent a camper van(need to clean it by ourselves, to charge it and to fill up water tank sometimes and to clean sewage...which is also taking time)...

1708825421.0,Looking for 1-2 towns to visit and stay in for an overnight in Franconia,"Hi all,

I'm researching and planning a visit to Germany in late June -- it will be both my and my friend's first visit. We're starting off with 4 days in Berlin, then spending a few nights in Saxony (1 in Gorlitz, 2 in Dresden), then will be continuing on to explore Munich and the rest of Bavaria. We will be traveling by car.

In my itinerary, I have us leaving Dresden in the morning and driving toward Munich by way of Franconia -- budgeting around 3 hours for that morning drive. We continue on to Munich the next morning, so I don't want to go \*too\* far west relative to Munich or north relative to Dresden. So far on my short list is:

* Tuchersfeld
* Bamberg
* Dinkelsbühl

Tuchersfeld was initially the top choice but it seems quite limited in terms of lodging. I would really like to see it -- it looks beautiful! -- but open to having lunch and walking around for a few hours there, and then moving to a second closeby town for lodging and dinner.

We'll be coming off a few outdoorsy days in Saxony and heading into pure city exploration in Munich, so really looking for a quaint, picturesque, somewhat quiet German town experience. Bonus points for not a lot of tourists (the reason Rothenburg didn't make the cut). Neither of us are super compelled to see Nuremberg, but we could be convinced.

In summary, my questions are:

1. Is Tuchersfeld worth visiting? If so, should we stay the night there, or should we continue on elsewhere for dinner and lodging?
2. Between the three towns, any standout favorites or comparisons that would help me narrow down?
3. Any other towns I should look into?",Europetravel

With all of the things I want to do in Italy I might only have just a few days that I could spend in Greece. The cost would be the same to fly to Athens then back home, or to just fly back from Rome.

1708669357.0,Looking for some itinerary suggestions for multi month Europe trip,"I've never done any long term travel before so just wanted a little input on some itinerary . I've seen a lot of posts about not rushing things and taking your time in each city, so I'm willing to cut out a country or two if it means enjoying the others more. I'm just having trouble letting any of them go so wanted to get some opinions first.

I don't have the day to day stuff planned yet as I want leave that a little more open rather than scheduling every moment. I do know I would like to visit at least one museum in each city (at LEAST one, I expect to see more lol), and one bouldering gym in each city (or any type of climbing). I also plan on bringing some art supplies so I can also spend a day in each city painting.

My current plan is:

Iceland stopover for 4 full days (5 nights)

Flying into London from there for 2 full days (3 nights). I'm not looking to spend a whole ton of time here, as it wasn't a part of my original plan. But it was cheapest to fly into so I'd like to see a few things if I'm already in the city.

From there my plan is a little more vague as I'm fortunate enough with my time and budget to be quite flexible. The plan is 7 countries, 8 cities in about 8 weeks. This leaves me about a week in each city.

Amsterdam

Berlin

Prague

Vienna

Zurich (will possibly change as I would like to explore the more rural scenery in Switzerland than the cities)

Florence, Rome

Athens

Like I was saying at the moment I am quite flexible, so I'm not 100% on each city yet, but this has been the plan so far. Greece is the place I'm most willing to part with only because it seems like it will be the most tricky one to deal with in terms of transportation. This is all pretty open ended as I'm still the the beginning stages of planning. Just wanted to see if anyone might have some input so far in regards to timing or any other tips you think worth mentioning.",Europetravel

1708611954.0,Do the trains really go everywhere?,"Me and my wife are planning a trip to Europe to visit Christmas Markets in December. We got the flight booked already as we found a good Premium Economy for under $2,000 / person and based on research if we wait much longer those go up $500/person the closer you get.



We're wanting to hit Brussels, Good areas for Christmas Markets in Germany, Amsterdam, and possibly Prague as well. We will have 9 nights to enjoy there.

We got a initial quote from a travel agency but they want to just do 3 spots and very touristy stuff - and it's almost $10k. We like things kind of off the beaten path, so don't need to be your stereotypical people on a tour bus like ""oh, there's the Eiffle Tower, there's Notre Dame, etc."" - would rather do what we want on our schedule.



My wife does not want to rent a car there - plus with it being December from what I read it can be snowy just like in the midwest US here. So trains / public transit appears a great way to get around. Google seems to have very detailed information for routes, for example the 620 line tends to get you from Brussels Airport to many hotels in the city, and you can take an express train from Cologne Germany to Prague via ICE 1552/ICE 552 and RegioJet bus 263 and it takes about 9 hours.



If the transit system is as good as rumor has it and as good as Google depicts - does it make more sense to get a EuroRail pass - and what is a legit site for that as some seem scammy - and does a Euro Rail pass cover bus line connections or do I just tap to pay on those busses?",Europetravel

I am making my first trip to Central Europe this spring, and I need some support with my itinerary. I will be leaving March 22nd, and returning April 21st. I need support with places to see, timelines, anywhere to avoid or skip, and the order I am travelling in. I will be starting in the Netherlands since that is where my plane lands/takes off, but I am unsure if I should do Poland or Germany afterward, and then do a loop. 

A bit about me: I love pre-history (Skara Brae is the best place in the world to me), medieval history, and weird/morbid history. I want to go off the path and see those little gems that take your breath away, especially if they are any kind of ruins or historic site! I am not as into cities or nightlife. Love hiking and nature! I will be doing all of this by train. 

My itinerary:

Netherlands:

* Day 1/2 - Land in Amsterdam at noon
   * See the sights around the city, the canals, Anne Frank House, Red Light district, etc. 

Germany:

* Day 3/4 - North Rhine-Westphalia (may cut for more time elsewhere) 
   * Stay in either Bonn or Aachen (may cut this, but works travel direction wise) - want to see the Neanderthal Museum, Church of St. Ursula, Cologne Cathedral, Aachen cathedral. Thinking about cutting this since I feel like I will get a lot of these pieces elsewhere on the trip?
* Day 5/6/7- Stuttgart Region (need advice on where to stay, since I have heard Stuttgart is not the best)
   * See the Pile Dwelling Museum (must for me), Celtic Museum (maybe) the Urgeschichtliches Museum, Hohenbaden Castle, and maybe the Urmensch Museum

Austria (trying to be here around Easter, since it seems like there are more options):

* Day 8 - Innsbruck
   * This will be around the time of Easter Sunday/Monday, so my expectation here is to more so enjoy the nature and some good food.
* Day 9 - Salzburg
   * See Salzburg Cathedral & St. Sebastian, potentially Friedhof St. Peter, & St. Peter Stiftskulinarium. Maybe add Eagles Nest as stopover on way?
* Day 10 - Hallstatt (Heard Innsbruck may be more worth while, so considering cutting to add day to Salzburg?)
   * See region, do the panoramic viewpoint, and the Welterbemuseum Hallstatt
* Day 11/12/13 - Vienna
   * See St. Stephens, Imperial Crypt, and sites around the city. Maybe a small trip to Bratislava?

Czechia:

* Day 14 - Brno
   * See the Pavlov Archaeological Park, and maybe the Capuchin Friars. Wondering if this is better done on the way to Prague?
* Day 15/16/17/18 - Prague + Day trip's
   * 2 days in Prague to see the city and see places like St. George's Basilica, Museum of Communism, etc. Add a half day trip to the Kunta Hora Ossuary, and a day trip to Český Krumlov.

Poland:

* Day 19/20/21/22 - Krakow
   * See Auschwitz, Wielicczka Salt Mine, St. Mary's Basilica, Wawel Royal Castle, etc. 
* Day 23- Warsaw
   * Warsaw Uprising Museum, POLIN, etc. 
* Day 24/25/26 - Gdansk
   * Malbork Castle, old town, potentially stop in at Torun

Germany:

* Day 27/28/29- Berlin
   * See the wall, the complex history, meet the city, maybe do a day trip to Wartburg (seems not really easy to get there, but it is also so out of the way from everywhere else I want to go)?

Netherlands:

* Day 30 - Amsterdam
   * Fly Home!

Areas that I want to include, but am not sure if worth it/am not as attached to:

*  Thoughts? If I add, will only be for a day or two. 
* Nuremberg, Munich, Hamburg & Frankfurt
   * Would be nice to stop through, but not sure if it would be too repetitive?
* Budapest
   * Would love to stop through, but don't think I have the time

1708559420.0,American driving in the UK,"I'm thinking of a family trip to the UK in June (2 adults, 1 senior, 3 kids under 12). We strongly prefer public transit because of our group size, but there are some places that are not really accessible without a car. So I have a few questions that I would appreciate your thoughts. 

For context, we are currently planning to visit London (plus Bath, Oxford or Cambridge, and maybe Blenheim Palace as day trips from London), York, Edinburgh, and probably Glasgow. All are easily accessible by train. We have about 19-20 days in total. 

First, are places like Cotswolds, Wales, and Scotland outside of the big cities worth it for a group like us?  I think we do like to visit some scenic and smaller cities, but the issue is whether the juice is worth the squeeze given the concerns below. 

Concerns include:

We will have to rent a minivan because we need to seat six. Minivans are usually harder to find, setting aside the higher cost. 

Are rental cars all automatic transmission? Only one of us knows how to drive manual transmission, and I don't know if the skill translates if the driver sits on the other side than what we're used to (like would it be shifting with the left hand instead of the right hand?)

My casual searching indicates that it will be hard for an American to drive in the UK because 1) we are not used to driving on the other side of the road, 2) the lanes are much narrower in the UK than the US and people drive faster, which is exacerbated because we will be driving a big / slower minivan, 3) it will be even harder to drive in more rural areas where the roads are not great. 

How valid are these concerns, or am I psyching myself out?  I don't want to be unsafe, and I don't know if the above are actual or imaginary problems. ",Europetravel

While we definitely don't anticipate this being the only time we go to Europe, it could be a while until we go back as we plan on having kids in the next few years. Therefore we are opting for more of a ""tour"" rather than a stay in one/two cities. Here is what we have worked up so far..

Fly into Dublin - stay 3 nights

Train to Limerick and stay for 1 night (partly due to a show we want to see.. and thought exploring more of Ireland wouldn't hurt)

Fly to Edinburgh the next day and stay there for 3 nights

Train down to London - stay 4 nights

Train to Ghent - stay 3 nights

Train to Amsterdam - stay 3 nights

Would this be too ""busy"" of a trip? My thought is that aside from the long train ride from Edinburgh-London (which I actually think would be enjoyable to see more of UK), and the annoyance of a mid-trip flight, all the other cities are around 2 hours from each other so wouldn't be too bad and we would get a nice flavor of each city. We also had Paris on the agenda at first but decided on Ghent instead because of the Olympics and being mid-point between London and Amsterdam. We also thought of passing through Belgium and doing London-Amsterdam-Berlin but were worried about train time and heard good things about Ghent and Bruges.

We appreciate any insight and if anyone has any ""must do's"" or hidden gems in any of these places please share as well. :)

1708584838.0,"Help with Itinerary from athens to london, budget backpacking","I’m in the very early stages of starting to plan a solo trip through Europe & would love any input or advice on how to best arrange my travel route.

I will be trying to budget travel and looking for the most affordable modes of transport between destinations. Im estimating roughly two months for the trip time wise and still trying to gauge an estimate for the budget of such a trip.

Im hoping to spend anywhere from 2-4 days excluding travel days at each location but also the kind of traveller who enjoys even visiting new countries briefly during layovers (bonus if modes of transports pass through other new countries). I know it’s not extensive time to visit each place and hope I’ll have a chance to visit the countries I really enjoy more thoroughly on a future trip.

The length/timeline of the trip is flexible based on overall expenses that i’m still working out.

I’ve come up up with a rough outline and would love to know how realistic it seems. 

Athens, Greece.
Italy
Switzerland
Munich, Germany
Hamburg, Germany
Copenhagen, Denmark
Amsterdam, Netherlands
Dublin, Ireland
Galway, Ireland
Edinburgh or Glasgow
London, UK - where I would fly home to Canada from

The places listed above would be my priorities to visit and see but there are some additional countries/cities I would love to include if possible even if just passing through.

These are:
Belgium - any specific city recommendations?
France
Vienna
Budapest
Spain

I’d love to know if you think this is a realistic time line for the places i’m sure on, if it’d be best to save the additional stops for another trip, how much time the additional stops would add on to the trip, budget expectations, travel modes, city recommendations- really any input or critique im open to! 

I’m also aware this could be aggressively ambitious but as i’m new to these kinds of trip I find it difficult to gauges!

1708517128.0,Crashed rental car in foreign country - help please,"Hi all,

We are UK citizens currently on holiday in Bosnia and decided to hire out a car for convenience. We booked through Europcar, and paid for the most expensive insurance and cover. All together the booking cost was approximately £700, and the security deposit we left on the credit card was £500. I am the main policyholder and my friend was listed as an additional driver. 

Unfortunately the additional driver was involved in a car crash yesterday in which the car was written off. No other drivers were involved, it occurred near a motorway junction where he was slowing down however the brakes felt weak, and with the wet ground the car ended up crashing into the metal barriers. It was not driven at excessive speed or recklessly. 

The police arrived on the scene and produced a report, we thought everything was okay and the police officers assured us they understood however in their report they wrote along the lines of us speeding resulting in the crash. A breathalyser was used and we tested negative, there was no speed cameras or any witnesses to indicate we had been driving reckless (we both have a completely clean licence) - so is it fair for them to state we had been speeding simply due to the pictures of the crash? As no other evidence would suggest so.

Then the car was towed and we went back to the rental company. They gave us a new car with no extra cost to us, however now charged the £500 deposit (which is understandable ofcourse). However when we asked about what would happen next, they said because the police report essentially said we had been speeding, the insurance and collision damage waiver could potentially become void. 

So could someone provide some insight into what this would mean for us? If the insurance was to become void, from my understanding, we would be liable for the entire cost of the car, which is beyond repair at this point. When we go back to the UK and they send us an invoice, and it happens to be for the value of the car - lets say around £30,000 - what could be done about this? 

We are both students and so simply can’t afford this sort of expense, would they chase up this amount once we’re back in the UK? How likely is it they would, and if they did what would be the consequences if we failed to pay? Would they able to take us to court in the UK, as the hire contract is under Bosnian law? Do we simply never visit Bosnia ever again?

Sorry for the all the questions, but as you can imagine we are extremely stressed out

Our original idea was to stay in Barcelona a few nights, then spend at least one night in the Pyrenees to visit Villefranche-de-Conflent (a town I love and want to share with everyone). Then either or both of Lyon and Bordeaux, and then a couple days in Paris. I’m almost positive this is too many places if we go to both Lyon and Bordeaux… but it’s challenging trying to decide what to include, not having been through this region. Does Barcelona, Lyon, and Paris make the most sense? Or Barcelona, Bordeaux, and Paris? Something else entirely?

We’re likely renting a beach house for the Barcelona portion, in Castelldefels, or hotel in city center. Hotel in Pyrenees is picked out. Rest of the trip can be a mix of either Airbnb or hotel; we’ve a budget of up to $1k per day for lodging. Most interested in hearing from folks who’ve done a fair amount of traveling throughout France what you think about prioritizing Lyon, Bordeaux, and Paris - or some other cities that might be on a better route for spending less time driving in between.

1708379171.0,itinerary advice (paris/switzerland/italy),"hi all! my boyfriend and i are planning our first europe trip for late april/early may and we’re looking at visiting paris, switzerland, and italy over the span of two weeks. i think planning paris will be fairly easy (i’ve been once before), but i’m a bit lost when it comes to switzerland and italy. 

after doing some research, i was pretty set on venice, rome, and the amalfi coast. then for switzerland, i’ve been seeing a lot about interlaken, lauterbrunnen, and grindelwald. i also saw a really cute little camping barrel airbnb in kussnacht. plus i was interested in the lindt factory in zurich. travel seems a bit intimidating too because we plan to train and use public transportation for the most part (except maybe renting a scooter for the day in amalfi). 

as you can see, i am all over the place and obviously want to see everything but have limited time. does anyone have any advice or recommendations on locations, the order of countries, places to go? coming from toronto and probably flying in to paris to start the trip. 

also worried about the weather at this time of year. wondering if it’ll be too cold?

1708394292.0,Planning week-long babymoon in May - tips on where to visit from Germany?,"Hey everyone. My husband and I live in the US but will be visiting Stuttgart for a family wedding in mid-May when I'll be around 26 weeks pregnant. After the wedding, we want to do a ""babymoon"" for 4 or 5 nights. I'd love to visit two different countries if possible, but I realize it may not be enough time to properly enjoy anything. This is where I'd like some help figuring out our itinerary.

We definitely want to visit Rome. Most people recommend spending 4 nights minimum here - does that sound about right? I also wanted to go somewhere with a different vibe - Lisbon would be the top choice (seems colorful/fun/romantic) but we also considered Barcelona or Amsterdam. We also discussed the possibility of mainly going to Rome but stopping somewhere in Switzerland on the way back, but TBH Switzerland seems too similar to Germany and I know his family goes there for vacation often so I'm sure we'll join them at some point. I'm trying to prioritize places farther from Germany that I don't think we will get a chance to visit regularly. We both prefer big cities and not much of a rural countryside vibe (at least for a majority of the trip).

Would 3 days in Rome and 2 days in another city be feasible/recommended? Or is \~4-5 days a must in Rome? Are there any other cities (in or outside of Italy) that we should consider? Any tips at all are welcome! Thanks!",Europetravel

We are headed to Europe for our honeymoon from about December 21 through January 6th. We would like to balance some Christmas festivities with some places where we can access warmer weather and do some outdoor exploring. 

**Christmas (3 ideas):**

We have been looking at Croatia and specifically the Christmas markets in Zagreb followed by some time in Dubrovnik or the Istria region. We love to explore and are comfortable off the beaten path/self-guided. The landscape looks incredible as does the Italian influence on architecture. 

We also thought of France and Alsace. We could start there for Christmas and finish out with time in Paris.  

We finally looked at Berlin and visiting the Christmas markets there and then heading out after. 

**Rest/Relaxation**

We would like to experience some time to relax and get outside. We have looked at the Canary Islands which seem to be a spot ideal for this in late December or early January. Looking for guidance on where in particular as we do not want to just sit around, but want to balance hiking, biking, etc. with a food scene. If we took this route, we could spend some time in another area of Spain and we have loved Barcelona. 

We are also open to warmer regions of Portugal, but know less about it.

1708387996.0,I will be going to Amsterdam and will have a car to drive around. Where do you recommend I go to?,"I’ll be flying to Amsterdam and driving to Brussels. I’ll be in Amsterdam for two days and I’m Brussels for three. I’ll be flying back out of Amsterdam but I have 2 extra days before I do. Me and my wife aren’t sure where to go for our two days? We were in Paris, Versailles, and Reims three months ago, so we’re not really wanting to go back to France. We’re not wanting to drive more than 6 hours away from Amsterdam since we’ll still have to make that drive back to return our car and catch our flight home. What locations would you recommend that is within 6 hours driving distance from Amsterdam if you had two days to squeeze in?

Edit: For those wondering why I’d be driving — I’m from the U.S. so driving is a big thing where I live. When we went to Paris and parts of France we drove around. It made traveling a lot easier for us. I enjoyed driving and am glad I had a vehicle. Is Amsterdam as crowded or crazy as Paris? If so that’s not a problem for me. I prefer being able to load up and travel in my own mode of transportation without having to be carrying our luggage around in Ubers or by train. We also like to look around and stop in small places that you wouldn’t regularly pass by train. I think our best experiences from France was stopping at smaller unknown cities and seeing things we wouldn’t have seen otherwise. 

Edit 2: Dang people, is having a car a sin in the Netherlands? I’m not talking about using my car around Amsterdam. I’m talking about my trip between Amsterdam to all other neighboring towns or countries such as Rotterdam, Luxembourg, Antwerp, etc. I was asking people what city they really liked that they would make an extra day trip if they were staying around Amsterdam. Everyone’s so focused on the car for some reason? I’ll be staying in Amsterdam. I’ll be walking around and taking bikes while I’m in Amsterdam. It’s my trip back up from Brussels that I’m wondering if someone has a really good recommendation. I will be using the car to get from the airport to my hotel in Amsterdam and then it will just sit there until my trip to Brussels. Spending the money on the car is not that big of a deal to me even if it just sits in the parking lot. It will get me from the airport to my hotel and the cost for renting the car for that day it similar to an Uber ride from Venice beach to Hollywood. It’s not that big of a deal. ",Europetravel

1708291259.0,Conflicted about how to split up our 10-day trip,"We've doing a 10th anniversary trip this fall. While we have had the opportunity to travel a lot within the US, it will be our first trip together to Europe and we want to see all that we can. Excluding the travel days to and from Europe, we will have 10 full days to spend. Wish it could be more, but that is all the childcare we will be able to find from family. The problem right now is figuring out how to split it up. Since we likely won't be able to visit Europe again until our kids are quite a bit older, we were originally thinking of trying to see a little of everything.

Originally, our plan was:

- Day 0 - Leave USA, redeye to Paris
- Days 1-4 - Paris
- Day 5 - Early train to Chur (TGV Lyria to Zurich, IR to Chur), then spend the afternoon and night there.
- Day 6 - Bernina Express, PM train to Florence (Tirano>Milan>Florence)
- Day 7 - Explore Florence, PM train to Rome
- Day 8-9 - Rome
- Day 10 - Naples, Pompei, stay night in Naples
- Day 11 - Fly home

However, after reading a lot of posts on this sub and other travel blogs, I'm concerned we might be making the common mistake of trying to see too much and not fully getting to explore each destination. I'm especially concerned with how little time we allocated to Rome, which has so much to see and do. We would also be spending quite a lot of time on trains.

Right now, the only real constraints we have are that we are starting in Paris and need to end in Naples (already bought flights). What changes would you suggest in the itinerary?

Some options I'm considering:

- Skip Florence and go straight to Rome on Day 6. That would give us one extra full day in Rome (Day 7), but would mean that pretty much the entirety of Day 6 would be spent on the train.
- Do we give up on Switzerland/Bernina Express and just fly straight from Paris to Rome on Day 5? If we caught an early flight, then we would get 4.5 days in Rome.
- Similar to above, but fly to Florence on Day 5 and spend half a day and night there, before heading to Rome on Day 6.",Europetravel

During the course of last month I’ve taken a lot of help from the group, listened to countless brilliant suggestions and frozen my iternery. I’m travelling around early April and will b here till last week of the month 


I’ve already booked all point to point travel and accommodation. Except the first and last leg everything is refundable (landing in Paris, Rome accommodation and flight from Rome to Paris and Paris to back is non refundable) 

Context: 

This is a solo trip and my first time in Europe. I want to see as much as is on my bucket list with minimum moving around and maximum relaxed time. The next time in Europe I’d like to do each country for a week or more. 

I don’t drink or party and would like to spend most time in art galleries, museums or nature (with minor hikes) 

Switzerland was an absolute must do for me so the number of days may look high to some people

This is not a budget trip but also not a splurge trip. I’d like to save money wherever possible but not at the cost of comfort 

Iternary: 

Day 1 land in Paris early morning, rest a little and half a day local sightseeing

Day 2-3-4 in Paris: the usual museums, general waking tours, half a day on shopping, river cruise etc

Day 5: take early morning fast speed train to brussels, drop luggage at the station and do a quick day trip. About 8 hours, take a fast speed to Amsterdam. Reach Amsterdam and rest

Day 6-7-8-9 local Amsterdam stuff: museums, eating, walking, “coffee shops”, chilling in the park, short trip to tulip fields, last night take a sleeper couchette to Basel 

Day 10: drop luggage at Basel station or closely and do the usual museums. In the evening take a train to Interlaken and rest 

Day 11-12-13: iselwald (1/2 a day), lauterbrunnen (1/2 day), mount Pilatus or titlis (half a day), Grindelwald (adventure activities 1 day), local trek  Lucerne (if possible), jungfrau (if possible)

This leg is still a little fluid as I’m figuring out logistics, local Swiss travel, costs etc however I’ve booked 4 nights at Interlaken to be centrally located 

Day 14: do local Interlaken for half a day or few hours, take bernina express route and eventually arrive in Venice. If time permits do a little bit of local sightseeing otherwise rest 

Day 15: Venice full day and at night take a train to Rome, Rest in Rome

Day 16-17-18 do local Rome and a day trip to a nearby beach if needed. On last day take a late night flight to Paris, hotel booked near CDG

Day 19: go to Paris Layafttes and do shopping and just relax in some cafe. Come back to hotel and sleep

Day 20: noon flight back to country (post vat refund)

Total days in each spot (not including travel time)

Paris 4.5 (includes a day of shopping), Amsterdam 4
,Brussels 1, Switzerland 4.5, Italy 4

Point to point travel?

Paris to brussels train 2 hours 
Brussels to AMS train 2 hours 
AMS to Basel overnight 10 hours (couchette)
Basel to Interlaken local travel 2 hours 
Interlaken to Florence train 9 hours  (scenic)
Florence to Rome train 2.5 hours

1708339413.0,Norse Airlines: International flight with disabled toddler and other madness.,"Short version: Can I check-in all 4 family members on an international flight on Norse Airlines by myself? Do the baggage police require a special tag on our underseat personal items (purse, backpack, etc) before we board the plane?

Details:
 My ""interesting situation"" : We're a family of 4 (kids age 2 and 3) flying this summer (mid May - mid June) International roundtrip Orlando to Gatwick (London) on Norse Airlines with a disabled child (cognitive and physical). I would be very grateful for anyone who can give a more factual or personal experience.
 I've purchased Priority Check-in and 2 checked bags on my ticket only. I was wondering if my husband and I need to BOTH be at the check-in counter at the same time? Can I bring everyone's passports to the counter and check-in for everyone while my husband is with the 2 kids in a low sensory area (quieter, darker area of the airport)? 

Also, we have a diaper bag (needed onboard) and double stroller (pram) that folds close that we need to transport the kids to the gate. Will they allow these items for free or will they charge extra for the diaper bag and stroller?
 
*** Clarification: I did go to their website and they said the stroller is free for under are 2. (This is strange, that's why I wanted advice)***

I've seen in some posts that there is a special tag that says ""approved underseat bag"" or ""approved carry-on"" that is given when checking in. Will we be flagged/stopped at the gate before boarding if our personal items don't have this?

Very grateful for your guidance. Thank you in advance.

1708284712.0,Help! Travel Itinerary Advice for September 2023,"Good afternoon, travellers!

I am planning a Europe trip for September 2025\*\*\* (Edit - Apologies for putting 2023 in the title). This all began with an impulsive booking of a Mediterranean cruise. The cruise is 7-nights, beginning in Ravenna, Italy, and ending in Barcelona, Spain. My partner has never been to Europe, and is pretty open to going anywhere. His cousin and his cousin's partner are coming with us, but they are doing a land-based vacation, staying with us before the cruise, and meeting us again after the cruise.

I am planning some pre and post-cruise land travel, and I am getting a little overwhelmed/stuck on what the best options may be. Here are my thoughts so far:

1. Fly to Dublin - spend two nights
2. Fly to Bologna, spend one night, then train to Ravenna in the morning to catch the cruise
3. Cruise will stop in Sicily, Rome, Florence, Nice, Provence, and then will end in Barcelona

Then, this is where I get stuck. We will stay in Spain for a few days, and hope to catch a football match. I would REALLY like to travel to Munich for Oktoberfest.. but I just don't know how much sense that makes, geogaphically. I'm not sure if it would make more sense to do Germany pre-cruise (although Oktoberfest will not have started if we go pre-cruise).

I have been to Europe a few times, but my partner has not, so I am really trying to hit the spots he wants to see. Some top places for him are Ireland, Scotland, Germany, Greece, and Northern France. Any suggestions are welcome!

However, last November I injured my foot real bad and mostly cannot walk. It is improving very slowly with physical therapy, but by April when I'm scheduled to go to Vienna I definitely won't be able to walk normally yet. I'll be able to walk inside my hotel room, but anything more than that I'll need to rent an electric mobility scooter.

I'm going back and forth about whether I should proceed with the trip. My bookings are all refundable and I'm not required to go so I can cancel without penalty, but if it's manageable it would be really nice to go.

**Does anyone have any experience with traveling to / in Vienna while being unable to walk? Any tips or considerations I need to think about to help me decide whether I should go?**

I know I can rent an electric mobility scooter from Mobile4Ever, but I'm also worried since 1) European cities are generally not very accessible for the mobility-impaired, 2) I'm not sure about how easy it is to navigate the public transport while being in a scooter, and 3) I can't use the scooter if it is raining, which it often does in Vienna in April.

1708214679.0,Best Spot for Christmas + New Years ?,"Hey guys, I’m wondering the best spot to spend Christmas and new years in in Europe. 

Seen lots of different tips online but here’s a bit more about our situation.

It’s my girlfriend and I, we’re mid 20s and will be spending 90 days in Schengen starting in October. 

For Christmas we really just want loads of Christmas lights and the Christmas vibes - of course we also want to check out some of these famed Christmas markets as well.

We also want to be somewhere good for New Years (big celebrations, fireworks, good night life, etc). 

The catch is we typically stay one month in each place we go to keep the cost down. We originally planned on starting the trip in Spain starting in October and starting in November we were thinking of staying in Budapest to be able to take easy weekend trips to Vienna and Prague. Maybe Paris for November. We also want to keep it on the cheaper side (the monthly rentals) and Budapest seems to be a top option for this reason for Christmas time, but also only want to be there if Christmas and new years will be great! 

Thoughts on these plans? Is there anywhere you’d suggest we look more into? 

Spain is the only place we 100% need to go to during the 90 days, but Budapest has always been high on the list. We plan on staying longer using treaties so if anyone has good tips on nice winter spots for January-March that would also be appreciated! ",Europetravel

I'm going to be going to Belgium in mid-July for a wedding.  I land in FRA and have 4 nights before having to be in the Dinant region in Belgium.  We plan on taking a train from FRA into BRU. From my research so far, places we are considering are Cologne, Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent.  

Is it advisable to base in BRU and take day trips to Ghent/Bruges? Or is it worth it to book a night or 2 in Ghent instead?

1708197553.0,"Need advice on Zugspitze (Grainau, Germany)","I'm going on an interrail trip this summer and we're staying in Munich for a few days. On one day we would like to go on a day trip to the Eibsee and the Zugspitze. I read that you can take the train from Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, then take another train called the Zugspitzbahn from Garmisch-Partenkirchen to the Eibsee and then after admiring Eibsee, take a cable car from Eibsee up to the Zugspitze. However, the Zugspitze site is the most confusing site ever. Is it really €62 Euros(!!) for a 10-minute cable car ride?! That seems insane; is it really worth it?

1708197110.0,Need itinerary advice - Italy and France,"Hello everyone,

I just booked my flight for Europe in May (April 29th to May 19th), 19 nights total.

**1-** Here is a rough draft of what I would like my itinerary to look like:

|**City**|**Date**|
|:-|:-|
|Rome|April 30 to May 4 (4 nights) - Arrival at 10:25 AM|
|Florence|May 4 to 8 (4 nights)|
|Cinque Terre|May 8 to 11 (3 nights)|
|Milan|May 11 to 12 (1 night)|
|Lake Como (Varenna)|May 12 to 15 (3 nights)|
|Nice + Menton|May 15 to 19 (4 nights) - Departure at 3:35 PM|

I would love if you could give me some insight on this itinerary, how you would change it up, add days to a city and remove from another. My parents told me I must visit Pompeii so I was wondering if it was possible to add to this list? Maybe with a part of the Amalfi Coast while I'm there?

**2-** A bit about me

I'm 24 years old, it would be my first time in Europe. I would be solo-traveling and backpacking, traveling by train between places and sleeping in hostels. I don't want to feel rushed or stressed and feel like I'm missing out but at the same time I know I will go back to Italy in not too much time so I don't feel like I need to see everything either. I like a slower-pace trip, I want to enjoy being in one place, get coffee, stop to read in a nice spot, without having a day packed with activities.

**3-** What are some must-see things and places in each city in my list? I would absolutely love to have recommendations of places to visit, restaurants, etc.

Thank you in advance, I deeply appreciate it!

The general plan is to fly into London and travel around most of western Europe by rail from there. I'm thinking of getting an EUrail pass to take care of most of the train expenses. The trip would last for 20 days, not counting the first day I arrive or the last day I'm there. I know I'd like to go to London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Brussels and maybe some smaller destinations along the way. After subtracting plane and rail pass expenses I should have a budget of $13,000 for everything else which works out to $650 per day. I also have around 400k credit card points to use for hotels.

My question is, is this overly ambitious? I started looking into it more seriously in the last day or so and it all just seemed too easy. Is there something I don't know about or that I'm not considering? Any advice at all is appreciated.

1708158652.0,EURAIL vs Swiss pass va flights,"Hi good folks,
Pls help me decide roughly which one could turn up to better on this inter Europe travel. 

I’m sharing the point of points I’ll need, doesn’t include busses or local subways I’ll need to use within the city. 

1) Paris to Amsterdam 
2) Amsterdam to Basel 
3) Basel to Interlaken
4) Interlaken day trips (Iselwald, Grindelwald, mount ttlis/ mount Pilatus, glacier express 
5) interlaken to Zermat
6) zermatt to Milan
6) Inter Italy travel (Milan, Florence, Naples, Rome)
7) Rome to Paris


Here are some things which are unclear to me.

1) point to point flights from Amsterdam to Basel are around 100€ with luggage, the sleeper tickets are 80€. Leaning towards train because it saves me 50€ in accomodation and 20€ in travel  
2) Within Switzerland I want to maximise fluidity and convenience of travel due to weather, also I may stay away from Interlaken to save accommodation cost and I’d need good connectivity in smaller towns of Switzerland so I’m leaning towards Swiss pass here (as it covers boat and buses too)
3) not sure how Italy intercity travel works.
4) i feel like Rome to Paris should be a flight since the travel time is over 15-16 hours. 


Here is my own take on some research I’ve done please share if you agree. Leaning towards option 2


Option 1
1) Take single ticket journeys from Amsterdam to Basel and for all inter Italy travel. 2) take Swiss pass for Switzerland 3) Take flight from Rome to France 

Option 2
Take eurail pass for Amsterdam to Basel, zermatt to Milan, all inter Italy travel 2) take Swiss pass for Switzerland 3) take Rome to Italy flight 

Option 3

Take only eurail pass use it everywhere and one Rome to Italy flight 


Any option option?

1708112355.0,"Looking for Mandarin-Speaking Tour Guides for elderly parents (London, Rome, Munich, Zurich)","Hi everyone! I'm very excited to travel Europe with my Chinese-speaking parents in 2025. We are making a stop in London, Rome, Munich, Zurich.

For context, this will be their first time in Europe, and I really want to make it super special. We grew up poor, working class immigrants who have never vacationed while I was growing up. They spent the entirety of the lives making sure my brother and I could focus on school and building a better life for ourselves. Now that I make enough money to take them traveling, I want to make sure they're able to absorb the culture in their native language.

**What I am looking for:**

* Mandarin-speaking tour guides in the locations I have laid out. Bonus points if they speak english as well.
* Half day walking / public transportation / private van tours of all the major attractions in these cities. Nothing too strenuous, as my parents are nearly 70 years old. I would like to take them *inside* the colosseum in Rome.
* Private or small group tours. None of those huge tours (20+ people) that make it hard to talk to the tour guide or feel super rushed.
* Price is flexible for me

**What I have tried looking at already -** I've done some research on various tour websites, but striking out! I'm U.S. based, so there may be other websites catered more to Chinese-speakers that I just don't know about. I'm able to speak Chinese, but cannot read or write fluently.

* Klook - really hard to identify chinese tours. No language filter.
* Airbnb experiences - I have found a couple of potential hits, but a lot of these ""tours"" are just photoshoots. I want someone with knowledge of the sights and culture.
* Tours By Locals - nothing when filtered for chinese

Myself and two friends are traveling to Italy from May 22nd to May 31st. We are looking for help with the itinerary. Here are the guidelines posed by the group:

Roughly around $3000-$3500 to spend each including airfare. We all have some form of points system whether that be Chase or Amex that we are hoping to utilize as well.

The cities we would like to see are Milan, Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and the Amalfi Coast. I totally get this is likely unmanageable, so what cities should we cut out or save for another trip?

On the 31st one of our friends must fly out of Rome and back to the States, so he is looking to train/fly back there prior to his departure and would like to be within 3 hours of Rome. If the trip were to end in Rome, that would work as well. If there is a cheaper flight out of Italy to the US that is more known, let me know as well. But from our research it looks like Rome is the easiest. 

My other friend and I can fly in or out of wherever, just looking for the cheapest, yet quickest (i.e. not a 30-hour travel trip that takes us through Turkey) route. So what city makes the most sense to fly in to. Less concerned with out of at the moment.

After the 31st and my friend leaves, I will have until June 9th to explore other areas, whether that be Italy or other European nations, so please feel free to give recommendations for that as well, as I am still planning that portion of the trip.

1708012441.0,One way motorcycle rental recommendations ,"Hello all! Last year I did a week of traveling via motorcycle along the Spanish / French / Italian coast.  I rented a motorcycle from ""MotoRent"", and pick up and drop off were both in Barcelona. 

This year, I'm flying into Rome and flying out of Barcelona, and I planned on a one way rental motorcycle. ""MotoRent"" told me the last time I was there that they did one way rentals all the time although it was more expensive. For some reason, they haven't answered my emails thus far, and I'm looking for other recommendations of motorcycle rental companies to use.  Hertz has been the best option so far, but definitely on the expensive side (approximately 3,100 euros for 5 days).  I'm just trying to see if anyone has other recommendations because I'd rather give my business to a smaller organization anyway.

1707913121.0,2 Week-Itinerary through Eastern Germany by train with the Deutschland-Ticket,"Hi there, 

My boyfriend (both in our 30s) and I are planning a longer vacation this Spring, around 2 weeks (dates are still tbc, most likely April 27th to May 12th). 

We had this (stupid? crazy?) idea of doing a train trip through Germany using the Deutschland-Ticket (leaving from and going back to Paris by train as well). We like traveling by train, we like Germany, we like financing the DB by not properly canceling our Deutschland-Tickets (all solved now).

We already know the Western side quite well since I have some family in Freiburg and near Hamburg and we have visited quite a few places in between. We'd like to explore the Eastern side more now, especially Dresden and Munich.

I'm kind of looking for some help to prioritize some destinations recommendations if you have any (I might have overseen some possible destinations or better options), and maybe a reality check (I've narrowed it down quite a lot already, but maybe it's still too much). 

What we want out of this trip : see different sides of Germany, cityscapes, landscapes, some culture, a few museums, nice walks, good food and beer, coffee shops, beautiful sunsets, some time to relax, nice places to run.

We'd arrive in Munich by train from Paris and take the train back from Frankfurt (TGV or ICE both ways - the Nightjet from Berlin/Erfurt to Paris which was another option is either already full or cannot be booked).  
Here is a tentative itinerary from what looks like the most convenient options if we don't want the train legs to be too long:   


* **Munich (5-6 days)**   
\- daytrip by train to Salzburg  
\- optional daytrip to Neuschwanstein Castle  

* Making our way to Dresden by regional train, stopping on the way for 1 or 2 nights in:  
Regensburg and/or Nürnberg and/or Bamberg and/or Bayreuth (not sure what to prioritize here)  

* **Dresden (5-6 days)**  
\-  daytrip by train  to Görlitz   
\-  daytrips by train to walk some of the Malerweg and explore the Sächsische Schweiz  

* Making our way back to Frankfurt slowly by regional train, stopping on the way for 1 or 2 nights in:  
Leipzig > Erfurt > Würzburg  

We'll obviously have to make some choices, but I have a hard time prioritizing, so I'm looking for some advice. 

Munich and Dresden are mandatory. The other cities less so, I'm afraid it might be too much (especially doing Regensburg, Nürnberg, Bamberg AND Bayreuth), so I'd be curious to know what people who know them would cut or even add if you have any recommendations.   
The  (Dresden >) Leipzig > Erfurt > Würzburg (> Frankfurt) sequence looks like the most efficient way to go from Dresden to Frankfurt by regional train in several bits while visiting some interesting cities, but maybe you see other options that I haven't considered.  
I know German trains are not the most reliable these days  (I've been recently traumatised by the 344 Minuten Spiegel Podcast, which I highly recommend if you speak German), but I'd really like to explore this side of Germany. I hope it's not a too stupid idea.

I have a special occasion at the end of March and would like to go somewhere for a week. I'll be working on the weekdays, so only 3 weekend days would be available from the morning to the evening. 

I've chosen Portugal and Spain as the destination since I've not visited these countries yet. What is very important to me in choosing one of these destinations is nightlife, and I do NOT mean partying, clubs, and bars. I'm not into that. I want the city to be wholly alive at night, with lots of shops and restaurants open till late. I want people actually out on the street, walking and living their lives. So after work each day, I could just stroll the city and enjoy seeing life. 

For a comparison, I live in Amsterdam, and it's dead after 6-7 pm. Sure, you can find bars or weed shops open, but people are mostly at home. You don't see what I call 'the flow of life' out in the streets. If I take a walk after work, I'll get gloomy at the sight of the dead city. But in my own hometown(in Asia), it was very different. Malls were open at least till 11. You could find lots of open restaurants(serving food, not just drinks) even after midnight. There would even be traffic on some highways, even at 3 AM. Of course, I know the culture is very different here in Europe, but I just wanted to demonstrate the two extreme ends of this situation.

1707788870.0,Central Europe 3-Week Itinerary Help!," Hello all!

I am planning a 3 week trip to central Europe for the end of March/first half of April. I am currently in the I want to see everything phase of planning, so I need some support and guidance with my itinerary.

Some things about me: I do not plan on renting a car but can if recommended, I love history (especially pre-history), weird and morbid history, museums about the place I am (not looking to see Egyptian artefacts in Berlin for example), traditional culture and dance, I love nature and hiking, I am not a big city or nightlife person. I am also someone that goes somewhere to see things, and usually when I travel I average about 50K steps a day, so rest days are not a worry for me.

Things I need advice on: suggestions of places to see, and suggestions on timelines. I do not mind taking days away from somewhere and putting them somewhere else. I also do not want to double up on places that are going to be much the same, so also open to switching things out there.

My itinerary so far (in order of visiting):

* Poland - thinking visiting for about 6 or 7 days. Hoping to see Gdansk, Warsaw, and Krakow.
* Czechia - thinking visiting for about 4 or 5 days. Hoping to see Prague, the Kunta Hora ossuary, and maybe some of the sites in southern Moravia such as the Pavlov Archaeological park.
* Slovakia (optional) - I have heard there is not as much to see here, so this is an optional piece. Maybe just a day trip to Bratislava to say I have been?
* Austria - thinking of visiting for 4 or 5 days. Hoping to see Vienna, the pile dwelling sites, Willendorf site, & Hallstatt
* Germany - thinking of visiting for 6 or 7 days. Hoping to see Wartburg Castle, Berlin, Schwäbische Alb, the route of megalithic culture, Bilzingsleben Site, maybe Tollense Valley, maybe Cologne?

Out of these places, Poland, Czechia, and Germany are must visits. Austria is a would really like to visit, but I have heard it may be similar to Germany so I am not too sure there. Slovakia is more so a may be passing through, but open to adding more days if people recommend!

Any help or advice would be very appreciated!

Already done on this trip: Brussels, Paris, Lisbon, Amsterdam and some smaller cities in the netherlands (and germany: spent day in düsseldorf lol)

I have traveled as a kid so also been to Madrid London Istanbul, going to UK later so 

My taste: Absolute favorite city so far was Lisbon/Sintra. It was magical. I loved the affordability of course, but also the kindness and the beauty of the streets and EVERYTHING and the climate and the authenticity of the culture and the fooood and the culture again and the metro was perfect and agghhh it was so perfect. 

As a kid I loved Istanbul. I don’t know what it’s like now but I loved the bazaars, the food, the colorful culture and beautiful mosques and buildings and streets. Truly unique but I was 7 so I don’t remember everything clearly (would be open to revisiting if anyone has advice on this and if it’s affordable) 

What doesn’t hit as much for me: 
Cities that feel very geared towards tourists and feel like they lack local culture but also don’t feel vast and international.

So many tourist traps, SO expensive and I didn’t find any good or cheap food, and I don’t smoke weed so …

Paris isn’t my favorite ever I did mostly non touristy things there, and that’s my favorite! I like to hit 1-4 tourist attractions but I like to walk around, thrift, get coffee, window shop and experience the vibes of a city rather than go in with expectations and uber from one tourist trap to another. I want to spend most of my time walking around and experiencing.

Italy is off the table because we’re going there as a class and then I’m spending week there (Venice as a class, then florence orvieto rome … not booked yet btw so if anyone has any suggestions lol) 

SO IM SORRY THIS IS SO LONG BUT:
Possible cities? 
Barcelona or Seville or Granada … I don’t know if I’ll click with Barcelona (I like going out but not too much) and I don’t know much about what to do in the other two. I didn’t love Madrid when I went when I was younger but I want to give spain another chance and I loved the cafe/bar culture. I also speak okay Spanish 
Prague - looks beautiful but flights/train very expensive and I heard it’s overrun with tourists 
Copenhagen - cafe culture, looks beautiful, but I don’t know much about what to do there…
Berlin - a definite unless you convince me otherwise…
Switzerland - i don’t want to go lol but my boyfriend does. don’t really want to do nature tourism in europe bc it feels inaccessible w public transit and switzerland is expensive…
Polish cities - had a layover here and it was gorgeous but don’t know really what to do/worry i’ll be underwhelmed
Budapest - heard some worrying things about how it’s disappointing but it lookslovely 
South of france - worried it’ll be disappointing or hard to get around 


Ahhhh I know this was a lot. I appreciate any advice. I really don’t want to waste my money or time, even though I know anywhere in Europe is worth it. I just don’t know if I’ll have an opportunity like this again and I want to make the most out of it.

I assumed this was the shoulder season and things would be cheaper? But I seem to be overshooting my budget already 

Iternery: 
Arrive in Paris
4 nights in Paris
Early morning train to Amsterdam
3 nights in Amsterdam
Early morning flight to Basel
2 nights in Basel
Base myself out of a city around interlaken and do grindelwald, iseltwald, jungfrau, titlis etc- 4 nights
Train to Milan/como/florence - 2 nights
Train to Rome
Rome: 3 nights
Back to France: shopping (1 night) and fly back next morning


But this is the current cost breakdown:

Intl flights: 500€ round trip
Intracity flights/ trains: 600€ (Paris to ams train 80€, ams to Basel flight 100€, Swiss pass ~250€, Italy trains 50€, Rome to Paris flight 100€)

Accommodation: (hostels) 19 nights: 1000€

That’s around 2k € just for accomodation and travel. Since my travel is around art and museums, I’d have about 500€ in entertainment/museum tickets easily. Food would be another 500€ easily (breakfast is included in accommodation).

1707651360.0,Please help me plan my family trip to Greece - Italy - Spain,"Heya, I'm looking for general advice and tips for traveling in Europe for the first time with a family (2 kids - 4yo and 6m). In general, we'd like to stay for 2-4 weeks in each country so we can explore them rather than see all Europe in 3 months.

I'd be working from 4pm to 12am local time which leaves the first half of the day to see places. The goal is to see which country and city we like, get a taste of European lifestyle and just travel.

The plan is:

- Fly to Greece in April and live there for 2-3 weeks. What's a good place to stay there - Athens? Any islands we can go to where there's a good internet coverage? Is it warm enough in April in Greece? Enough to see for 3 weeks?

- Move to Italy in May for 3-4 weeks. What are 3-4 cities you recommend staying? We'd love to see Rome and Sicily. General advice for traveling in Italy please 

- Go to Spain for the last 4 weeks. Again, what are 3-4 cities you recommend staying? We'd love to see Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia. General advice for traveling in Spain please 

More specific questions (feel free to answer only what you know):

1. Should we stay in one city in each country vs 3-4 to see more places? Is it a silly idea to move a lot within one country or accommodation cost should be similar across the country?

2. How much approximately 1 month would cost in each country if we eat out only once per day?

3. Did we get the order right? Hottest country, Greece, in April but then not sure if June is better and less crowded for visiting Spain or Italy?

4. Are all countries suited for family trip i.e. our 4yo would not be bored?

5. What's the best website for booking accommodation in each country.

I want to finally get over there to visit, and I think I'm gonna spend about a month in Europe. I've never been to Europe before, and I'm trying to figure out how to spend my time.

Truthfully, Austria wouldn't be high on my list, but that's where my buddy is, and I hear great things about Vienna from many people. I was thinking of spending about a week in four different countries, maybe two weeks in one. I don't want to rush through any place that deserves more time. I'd rather see fewer countries and really get to see them, if it comes down to it.

Here's tentatively what I was thinking:

-A week in Austria (maybe minus a couple days)

-A week in Croatia (maybe going all the way to Sarajevo?)

-A week in Italy (was thinking about Italy being were I might spend two weeks)

-A week in one other country (Span or Germany probably)

-I really want to end the trip in Amsterdam. Was thinking about just three days or so in Amsterdam to cap off the trip

Feel like I should probably spend a day or two in London too while I'm going over there. I'm interested in France, but as far as western Europe would probably prioritize Italy, Spain, and Germany, and France is somewhere else where I might want to spend longer than a week (Spain is too, for that matter).

I know I won't see all of Europe in one month. I'll definitely be back again in my life. Just beginning my international travel journey with this trip. Maybe I should make Spain and France their own trip later on down the road. Or perhaps I should focus more on western Europe this trip and come back later for the Balkans. Greece would be interesting too...

Total trip length is a little flexible. Am planning for about a month, but I could add on a week or so. I could leave in early-to-mid June and just have to be back in the States by mid-late July.

Just looking for input about the timing, how much time I would want to spend in the countries I mentioned in this post, wisdom of the routing, stuff like that. I'm open to moving things around.

When booking, is it better to book directly through DB/ÖBB/SBB or to use one of the third party resellers like Rail Europe?

1707499651.0,Mid-April ~14 day trip: Prague/Budapest/Vienna or Rome/N. Italy/Lake Como/Switzerland?,"I can’t choose between these two places for the second and third week of April

For Prague/Budapest/Vienna we’d probably spend around 3-4 days in each city and then go to Salzburg qnd ride some scenic trains. Havent been to any of these places yet!

For the Swiss/Italy trip, we’d probably start in Rome (5 days) and then work our way up to Bologna (2 days), then Verona or Bergamo (1 day, which one?), then Como (2 days) then take scenic trains like the Bernina Express in Switzerland (will Lauterbrunnen/Grindelwals be green and in bloom by then?). Also for reference, I’ve been to Rome, Florence, and Venice before (loved Rome and Italy in general so much)

Preferences:

- Of course Rome will have the best weather but we’d more prefer to see spring flowers in bloom and fresh greenery even if there’s some chilly spring weather. Would Switzerland offer that or is it too early? Would Lake Como be in bloom? I’ve heard that there are some lovely cherry blossoms in Budapest and Prague?
- We love strolling around and exploring charming and beautiful neighborhoods 
- Into great food at all price points
- Really into coffee and desserts as well
- Very interested in gardens, parks, natural scenery, etc especially for spring!
- Really not into Paris bc of its relatively monochromatic architecture, cramped car-filled streets, and imposing large plazas (I like smaller human scale plazas) - if this sounds like any of these first cities please let me know. Really have liked Rome, Lisbon, Seville, and London though. 
- Budget for accommodations: €100-200 a night (except switzerland- willing to pay more if it’s worth it during april)

By the time I end up in these 2 countries, it will be late June/early July.

I will be travelling solo and will be staying in hostels.  

I have briefly visited Italy before.  Italian food is one of my favourites. I’ve never visited Spain before but over the years it seems to be a lot of people’s favourite place to travel. 

I’m hoping to get perspectives of people who have been to both countries please. 

My favourite things to do while travelling:
1. Eating good food
2. Swimming. Lots of swimming. Preferably fresh water.
3. Seeing beautiful buildings and history.
4. Hiking (easier hikes)

1707468484.0,"Is it worth spending ~10 days in Oslo if I'm looking for a lot of things to do in the daytime (museums, coffee shops) etc. and a vibrant nightlife (pub crawls, karaoke bars)?","Hello,

I was wondering if it's worth spending \~10 days in Oslo if I'm looking for a lot of things to do in the daytime (museums, coffee shops) etc. and a vibrant nightlife (pub crawls, karaoke bars)?

I've already been to Oslo once around 5 years ago and I stayed there for a week. I've been to the museum where they have The Scream (the painting) and I've been to a Viking museum which was structured like a viking village and I had to take a bus to get there. I've also been around the city centre, visiting the place with a lot of statues, I've seen the beautiful modern opera house etc.

From my impression of Oslo from 5 years ago, it doesn't seem like it's really vibrant during the weektime. Only on the weekends people go out (and get excessively drunk), but during the week it's mostly dead. Am I correct? Would you spend some of your vacation days in Oslo if you were looking for what I am looking for?",Europetravel

We are confused on how exactly the eurail pass works; some of our travels includes getting on and off on the train. For instance, we are travelling from **Amsterdam to Switzerland** and **(Switzerland) Kriens Mattenhof  -  (Milan) Milano Centrale,**

Upon checking, it requires getting in and out of the train a lot:

**Amsterdam Centraal Station - (Switzerland) Kriens Mattenhof (since this is the closest station near our booked hotel)**

amsterdam - frankfurt main ( 4 hours )

frankfurt msin - basel sbb ( 3 hours )

basel ssb - olten ( 30 mins )

olten - luzern ( 35 mins )

luzern - kriens mattenhof  ( 4 mins )

kriens mattenhof - luzern ( 6 mins )

luzern - bern ( 1 hour )

bern - milano centrale ( 3 hrs 6 mins )

Any other tips for a couple traveling to Europe? We really are trying to see as much as we can and we don’t mind having to hop around but also we want to make sure we soak everything in as well. Thank you guys!!!

Edit: Amazing answers thank you so much! Truly an exciting time",Europetravel

Zurich
Strasbourg 
Antwerp
Amsterdam

We are huge foodies! We may visit one or two museums (Anne Frank house absolutely) but we love eating local cuisines and wandering around the streets enjoying the scenery and our time together. 

Please drop your must eat, must drink or must see! Neither one of us has been to any of the above places. We arrive March 1 and will be traveling by train throughout our trip. 

We chose Zurich as it worked best with flights and have the longest stent of our trip there as we do plan to take trains up the mountain and around surrounding areas.

1707339953.0,"19 day France/Italy itinerary, choosing Strasbourg/Lyon + traveling through Germany issues?","Thoughts on this itinerary? I'm not sure if I should choose Strasbourg or Lyon as I appreciate architecture and history a lot but am also very into cooking and appreciating+trying to learn how to make good food. Another concern is that if I choose Strasbourg over Lyon, flying to Venice might be more complicated since Google says the most reasonable flight from Strasbourg would be 17 hours and require me to take a train to Frankfurt first. The flight from Lyon to Venice would only be 1.5 hours.

As a Canadian, I don't think I would have to worry about visas, but I assume having to travel through Germany before flying might require me to fill out some additional forms and documents.

1707327930.0,Spending two weeks in Italy in March…clothing and politics lol,"Long post. Wife’s bucket list item - spending multiple nights in Rome, Naples, Florence, Venice & Milan. Busy itinerary, and booked a tour with a reputable company, because it’s our first time in Italy - though not our first time in Europe.

A few concerns. 

I’m told that typically, Italian people dress less casually than than people from the US.

My wife will be fine, she’s already planned  her wardrobe for the entire trip.

I’m planning on collared shirts and nice t’s, in darker colors, paired with chinos and a nice fitted leather jacket, for being out and about during the day - with some nice looking Merrell slip-on hikers or Van’s. Can I do jeans, or is that bad form?

Evenings out will probably be similar except for dressier shoes - and definitely no jeans -  will I need a sportcoat or jacket or can I get away with leather for dinner too?

Politics. Will Italians be curious enough to ask my opinion on US politics or is that considered bad manners? Don’t get me wrong, I can be as noncommittal as the next person, but I would really just as soon not go there. What my fellow travelers may have to say on the subject is actually more worrying lol.

Last, will we be treated a certain way - I mean badly - being Americans? My wife & I tend to be low key, courteous travelers, and prefer to immerse ourselves in the culture surrounding us - we’re not loud or obnoxious - I hope! I was expecting the worst on a stay in Paris, but found Parisians to be kind & helpful, without exception. Will the majority of Italians be welcoming/friendly?",Europetravel

1707314675.0,"Here's how I Saved $2,000+ on Rooms in Ireland in 2024","TL;DR: I saved $2,235 over 17 days by contacting places directly and asking for available rooms within my personal nightly budget.

Hotels and AirBnBs in Ireland were scarce and EXPENSIVE in August 2023.

Beds in Dublin were even worse.

I decided 'last minute' to take my family to Ireland for 17 days in 2023.

In June 2023 we hadn't started planning the trip yet so when I got around to looking for places to stay in the cities and towns we wanted to visit, I was shocked by the high costs ($650 per night for 4?!) and how many places were fully booked.

[Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and AirBNB were not helpful as all the options were not available or affordable for my budget-minded (ie cheap, frugal, shoestring) sensibilities.

If we wanted to go to Ireland for the Summer, I need to find beds for my family of 4.

Here's what I did:

1. Open Google Maps
2. Search for ""\[Hotels or Traditional Bed & Breakfast\] in \[Destination City\]
   1. example: ""Traditional Bed & Breakfast in DIngle""
   2. example ""Hotels in Dublin""
3. List the top 10-25 results closest to the center of my city of choice
   1. grab their Email
   2. grab their Phone #
   3. if no Email or Phone number, grab the URL of their website's Contact form
4. Directly contact each location with the following message
   1. ""Hi. My name is NiagaraThistle. I will be in \[DESTINATION\] for \[# OF DAY\] starting on \[CHECK IN DATE\]. I am looking for a room for \[# of PEOPLE\]. **My total budget is \[$XX - NIGHTLY BUDGET\] per night. Do you have anything available for these nights at this budget?""**
5. Wait for replies.

Obviously not all places replied. Some places flatly told me their over-inflated room costs, or that they were fully booked. A few laughed at my audacity.

But a very small few replied back that they did in fact have available rooms for us at my requested nightly budget.

Some required that I pay in cash. 

Others advised some (non-essential to my family) amenities would not be included in the discounted price.

Were these places 5-star locations? No. Were they going to make the top influencers' Instagram photos? Probably not.

But were they affordable, comfortable, friendly, safe, clean, and 'mostly' central? 100% yes.

A few of the places were actually surprised I contacted them because they wondered how I found their contact details as they do not use the booking sites. 

I saved $2,235 over 17 days by doing this. It just shows how inflated the prices at hotels and those specifically using the booking sites have gotten.

So much history. So many regions that are distinctly different from one another. Great food. Wonderful small towns.

So much organized chaos!

I hope this is helpful to some of you.

# Venice

Spend **at least 2 nights** here.

Don't show up for 1 day, fight crowds, stand in lines, grab a selfie, and leave. You are doing it a disservice and you won't get to experience the magic and uniqueness that is Venice. Take a vaporetto down Grand Canal, see the main sites, then head AWAY from the crowds. Get ""lost"" among the alleys in some ""unknown"" part of Venice. Pop into a little bar and try whatever 'cicchetti' (bar snacks/appetizers) the owner or a local suggests.

Check out Murano or Burano as a 1/2 day trip if you spend a 3rd day here.

# Cinque Terre

I love these towns. It was my first taste of Italy, and I love them.

However, it seems like every youtuber and influencer also loves them as do all the big bus groups thanks to Rick Steves (that's how good his guidebooks are) so that you get MASSIVE amounts of day trippers arriving in the mid mornings and leaving in the mid-evenings. It gets crowded.

Does this mean you should skip? NO!

Spend a couple nights in one of the towns. Riomaggiore has always been my favorite, and I have amazing stories from here, but there are 5 to choose from. Wake up early and walk the Via Dell'Amore or other parts of the path that connects the towns before the majority of tourists swarm in. Head out later in the day when most tourists are leaving. Between those times, just relax and explore the towns away from the tourists crowds.

Plan your stop in Cinque Terre as a ""vacation from your vacation"".  Spend a couple days in the middle of your trip where you are not sightseeing or trying to hit 10 attractions in a day. Just strolling around town, sitting at the beach or at a restaurant relaxing.

# Florence

You could spend a life time in Florence and not see everything.

But you have 1-2 days , so plan your time wisely. Get reservations for both the Uffizi and L'Accademia. It is possible to blitz Florence and see it ‘all’ in a day - or at least it used to be:

&#x200B;

1. Arrive in Florence
2. Visit the l'Accademia, see Michelango's David
3. Uffizi Gallery
4. Piazza del Duomo  
   1. Baptistry
   2. Climb Giotto's Tower
   3. Cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore (il Duomo) interior
5. Piazza della Signorina - Have a picnic lunch (if still allowed) surrounded by famous sculptures
6. Walk to the Arno river and cross Ponte Vecchio.
7. Piazzale di Michelangelo for sunset over Florence.

You won't see everything Florence has to offer, but with a good plan and reservations to the museums, you will see enough to know that Florence is great and worth a second trip.

**Note:** Read **Dan Brown's ""Inferno""** for a thrilling overview of Florence. It will make a bunch of the sights really come alive for you when you are right there.

# Pisa

Skip Pisa unless you have a truly burning desire to see the Leaning Tower.

If so spend the 1/2 day you will waste getting to and from here only to see the sole attraction of the city. I came here to just to see the Leaning tower, and quickly realized I could have spent more time elsewhere.

In retrospect, I think the time to get here, see the Piazza dei Miracol and get back to anywhere else is too long to warrant visiting, but I get it.

# Hilltowns

Make some time to spend a day exploring at least one countryside hilltown in Italy.

Popular ones include:

* San Gimignano
* Civita di Bagnoreggio
* Orvieto

But there are other great small countryside towns to explore in Italy.

### Sienna

Consider a 2-night stay.

I've never been but my Brother-in-law loves it.

### Rome

Like Florence you could spend a lifetime here and not scratch the surface.

Spend 3 nights here minimum and break the sightseeing into overlapping chunks:

* Catholic Rome

### Southern Italy

If you head to Southern Italy, I’m partial to the Calabria region.

It’s the toe of Italy's boot and you’ll probably want at least 3-4 nights to explore this region and get back to the north. Calabria is known for its pristine beaches, ancient historical sites, and rugged natural landscapes.

* **Tropea**: Renowned for its breathtaking clifftop views and historical depth.
* **Scilla**: Offers a glimpse into the region's mythological past and is known for its picturesque beauty.
* **Reggio di Calabria**: Home to cultural treasures at the National Archaeological Museum, highlighting the rich history of the area, and is the gateway to Sicily.

This lesser-known region offers an authentic Italian experience, combining breathtaking natural beauty with a rich tapestry of history and flavors.",Europetravel

I am planning on a few days in to a destination that has a direct flight to Tromsø, like Berlin, Frankfurt, Paris, etc. But this post just pertains to my Tromsø itinerary.

If anyone has any tips or answers to my inquiries below, that would be great!

- what should be my budget be for everything minus flight cost if my main priority is to do activities including northern lights tour, dog sledding, fjord boat cruise, cable car to Storsteinen, etc.; not really heavy on shopping if that’s relevant info

- what sites are recommended for booking tours and experiences? what experiences are a must in addition to what I already plan on doing?

- is it better to go on November vs January vs December vs February or are the chances of seeing the lights pretty much the same for these months?

- Anything I should know about getting around Tromsø? I read so far that the main public transport is bus and that I can’t use card to buy a ticket on the spot unless I have the app (which I read on another thread it doesn’t accept all types of credit/debit).

1707149494.0,"In 1999 I Backpacked Around Europe for $3,500 for 3 Months. Is this still possible?","Maybe a bit ""clickbaity"", and I KNOW it is almost impossible to do this for $3,500 today.

BUT, my actual ask is ""Is it possible to backpack around Europe for a laughably low cost?"". Let me clarify:

In 1999 4 high school friends and I decided to travel to Europe to visit our favorite soccer clubs.

We consulted with one fried's mom who consulted with her travel agent (this was before any of us even knew what the Internet was). The agent advised we could do **TWO WEEKS for $3,500.** We were pumped, but I didn't have any money, nor parents that could bankroll my travels.

Long story short: 

* By chance I came across Rick Steves' 'Europe Through the Back Door', 
* Gained confidence I could turn 2 weeks into **3 Months** for the same budget ($3,500)
* Bought a backpack and Unlimited Global Eurail Pass
* Paid $365 for a Round Trip Own Jaws ticket through AirHitch

My friends and their parents laughed at me and thought I was both Naive and Crazy, and not one of my friends stayed the summer with me. We did have a fun 2 weeks, and when they got of the plane meeting me in Rome, they DID change from suitcases and rental cars and big hotels, to backpacks, eurail passes, and hostels. But none shared my belief we could do it for $3,500 for the summer.

I had a great adventure over the summer and have been chasing that same feeling on every subsequent trip since.

But after my trip to Ireland this past Summer, I realize how expensive things have gotten. It doesn't just seem like simple inflation either.

A hostel in Dublin was $150+ per night in a DORM room (i stayed in hotels as I now travel with my wife and kids, but am still cheap as h... I mean 'budget-conscious').

**TL;DR: So I am wondering, while $3,500 for 3 months might be impossible, is it still possible to travel around Europe on a shoestring budget that would seem laughable to others?**

The primary reason I am asking is because when my kids graduate High School I want them to have worked to save money for a similar trip to my first one. I want to gift them a Eurail pass and hand them their backpacks and passports so they can have a very similar experience to what I had when I went 25 years ago.",Europetravel

**(Español abajo)**  
I'm planning a trip to Madrid for 4 days and would love some advice for my itinerary. I'm traveling with two others and we'll be staying in central Madrid. I'm trying to go as cheap as possible here. Also, none of us eat pork.

I’m looking for more local hidden gems, historic sights, some cafes/eateries, and must-try foods. I don't have any food places picked out so I'm mostly concerned about those. I don't want to eat foods I'm used to as an American nor pay the ""travelers tax."" I just want some authentic Spanish cuisine. We are also big fans of middle eastern food and we'd like to try Moroccan. If there are any good places that match any of that, please let me know. And if my itinerary isn't doable, please let me know as well so I can prioritize my favorites. 

I'm also wondering how often Spaniards would be willing to talk to me in Spanish there as a foreigner. I have about a B1 understanding and I've heard that there are some English speakers in Madrid because of the popular travel destination. The main point of my travel is to practice, so I'm curious. Which, by the way, if there are any good opportunities to practice speaking to locals, that would also be great to know! 

Here's a rough draft of my plan:

Day 1:

La Latina and the Sunday flea market there

This will be our grocery and scouting day as well. We don't have much else planned

Day 2:

Toledo via train. I want to see the Toledo Cathedral, San Juan de los Reyes, Mezquita Cristo de la luz, El Alcazar, and Plaza Zocodover. I also heard Paseo-Mirador Virgen de Gracia or walking to the miradors along the south bank of tagus was a good place to see the city. I don't know which has a better (free) view

Day 3:

This is central Madrid day. We'll start early but I don't know if all of this is manageable in one day.

The Arab wall, museo nacional de prado, retiro park, palacio real and garden, plaza mayor, temple of debod, and the malasaña neighborhood. We want to try the chocolateria san gines for churros at plaza mayor as well.

Day 4:

Chinatown in the morning and then were going to a soccer game in the evening. It would also be good to know how early to get to the game to avoid complete chaos. It starts at 9pm and is a pretty big match. How crazy are the metros afterward too? 

Day 5?

Our plane takes off at 7pm so we'll get there at 3:30pm or so, but we don't really know what to do with the morning. Good cafe recommendations, nice walking routes, etc, would be appreciated.

Día 3:

La muralla árabe, museo nacional de prado, parque del retiro, palacio real y jardín, plaza mayor, templo de debod, y el barrio de malasaña. También queremos probar los churros de la chocolatería san gines en la plaza mayor.

Día 4:

Barrio chino por la mañana y luego íbamos a un partido de fútbol por la tarde. También sería bueno saber a qué hora llegar al partido para evitar el caos total. Empieza a las 9 de la noche y es un partido bastante importante.

Sharing my rough plan and cities.
I’ve very rough idea of things I want to do basis that I’d help your thoughts in cutting out some cities as the general consensus seems to be that one shouldn’t waste time travelling to and fro cities. 

My key interests everywhere would be:

1) art, museums and galleries : both traditional and modern art
2) nature walks, sightseeing, walking tours and some light adventure activities
3) I’m not into partying and drinking but wouldn’t mind meeting new people and making friends through my journey
4) overall I’d like the trip to be relaxed where I’m not rushing from place to place and am generally not jam packed with places

Some cities which are on my list and no of days id like to Spend in each, basis my research: 

1) Paris 🇫🇷 (4): 3 for sightseeing and 1 for shopping (before my return flight)
2) Interlaken and surrounding (titlis, lauterbrunnen, jungfraujoch, Iseltwald, grindelwald) 🇨🇭 (4)
3) Basel 🇨🇭(2) (mostly art)
4) Amsterdam🇳🇱 (3) (canals, walking, Van Gogh, Ann frank house, 🌱)
5) Rome 🇮🇹 (3) the usual 
6) Florence 🇮🇹 (2) the usual 
7) Milan 🇮🇹 (2) the usual
8) any beach location (I’ve been told it’s very difficult to do beach days in Europe in April but hoping for some recommendations if any)

My questions are:
a) is train the best way to move between these two spots? Or is the hassle of flying worth it?

b) is the timetable for the fast trains between Avignon TGV and Paris the same all year round? (i.e. will the times showing in May be the same on the corresponding day (eg. both Sundays) in August?

\- Could we do this trip for less, say €12,000? (not including flights.). 

\- Will a Eurorail pass be cheaper or individual trains? Particularly since we will be on a few overnight sleeper trains. 

This is my first time organising an itinerary, and our first time traveling to Europe.

I would appreciate any input and advice on extending/cutting time in areas as well as tips on train travel, cheaper areas to stay in etc. 

Thank you!

I have Verizon and would do their international service plan if that would work well for using my cell phone as a hotspot to connect to WiFi from my laptop? Not sure how effective that option is.

We have a wedding we are going to in Tuscany in mid October, but are taking the week before the wedding to explore from Barcelona to Tuscany. We have elected that the most effective way for us to travel is by train and we decided that theres no way we will be leaving our 10 month old at home with grandparents for the nearly 2 weeks that we will be gone in total. We will consider car rental once we get to tuscany, but dont know how licensure works and all that stuff once we are there.

My husband and I love food, art, nature, and culture. We aren't drinkers. We like doing slightly less touristy things, but definitely want to see the Dali museum, some South of France realness, and then are open to traveling all the way down to Rome before reaching back up to Tuscany. Food experiences are really important to us. Id also love to get a day of nature in there somewhere.

We will be packing very light. We will probably have one large rolling suitcase, two backpacks, and a compact travel stroller. However, having access to something like a luggage locker for some relief of our baggage before we can check-in for our evening accomodations will be super important for us too.

We were thinking that its likely we will travel an hour or two in the mornings, arrive wherever we decide to go, and then spend the day there basically on foot (we wont have a car seat). So, only a few things to focus on at each place. We would be willing to spend multiple days somewhere if its really worthwhile, but want to see as much of the different places as possible.

1706935840.0,Alps and Blooms in April,"I am having a heck of a time trying to figure out our pre summer trip. Last year we started in Geneva, went to Evian, France over to Zurich and to Munich. From  Munich we went to Innsbruck for a half day and Nuremburg for half a day (Munich was our base). Absolutely not enough time in either place. Munich was our base for 5 days and that worked out well. 

We love the Alps. There is so much more of Europe I want to see, but I can't get the Alps out of my head. It's like a siren song. 

We are looking to travel again at the end of April, luckily we live close to a US airport that flies to most larger international cities.  There is a lot of flexibility where we fly into and out of.   I don't want to completely repeat what we did last year, but I just need to get my view of the Alps.  

I also would love to get up to Holland, as it's gorgeous in springtime.  We generally stay at Hilton hotels due to status (it's worth it over there, room upgrades and executive lounges = free meals) and we get 2 free nights. It's limiting in some ways and not all nights have to be at a Hilton property, but it helps for the bulk of it. 

Here's where my head is, please provide feedback. 

Fly into Vienna or do this in reverse 
5 nights in Vienna (this includes a free night when using points)
2 nights in Innsbruck
1 night in Nuremberg (we went last year and wanted to spend more time), it's more so as a stopover to break up travel 
3 nights in Brussels or Amsterdam (fly out from there), one or the other, not both of

I've been to Vienna and Amsterdam before, but not Belgium.  We'd be taking the train.  

Is this just flat out stupid?  I don't want to completely repeat the trip from last year but this would give us a few days in the Alps. And we'd do several day trips from Vienna. No desire to go back to Zurich and Switzerland is gorgeous but too pricey.

I’d love to hear some opinions?

For context, my daughter does have some physical limitations and sometimes struggles with uneven ground. But if she is stimulated by her surroundings, can push herself and thrive.

I don’t want to use this sub to ask a question about Pena Palace. And I also am not using this to ask about how to get there. Both have a lot of reddits and what not on. 

But my likely consensus on Pena Palace is that we will see it from outside and the gardens. 

Now the rest of the sites in Sintra are a bit more complex in planning. But my assumption is I should visit 
1. Quinta de Regaleira 
2. Park and Palace of Montserrate 
3. Castelo De Mouros 
4. Sintra National Palace

First of all, I would really appreciate if some people could give me their opinion on the itinerary I started thinking about. I feel like it's a lot of cities for 30 days, plus traveling between each one, but I'm really not sure, I don't want to feel rushed and leaving feeling like I missed out on so much. I'm open to suggestions on how to change it, places to forget going to (since it's only my first time and I definitely plan on going back later in life, so I don't have to see everything), etc. I'm really flexible on the dates and number of days spent in each city, but I would have to be in Lisbon on May 24-25 for a concert.

Also, feel free to give me advice, things to see and do in these cities I would really appreciate it.

I guess my question is would this be a realistic way to spend 14 days in Europe? Enough to at least see the sights without feeling completely rushed? In my mind it seems very doable, but having never been to Europe I’m not sure what to expect.

Thank you for any advice!",Europetravel

This will be our first time in Europe and we’d like to keep a good pace, but still leave time for some rest stops along the way. The goal isn’t to pack each day full of sightseeing, but rather to pick one or two “must sees” each day and then use the rest of the time exploring and discovering.

I going to do Southern and Central Europe, an undetermined time in Germany, Amsterdam and may try Poland, and if affordable a few days in Helenski, Stockhold or Oslo (maybe all three).  I would like to do a few days in Iceland.

Definitely want to see Slovenia.

Unless there is a great deal I am probably going to pass on Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, and Albania.  Might do a little time in France if it ends up being convenient.

I was thinking of getting an open ticket, or just buying a flight from the U.S. and a return and just traveling wherever I feel like with no plan in between.  I would be booking as I by the day or week.

Would travel with a normal sized backpack with a heavy Laptop and 1 suitcase.

Trying to determine the trade off of freedom versus cost.  My thoughts is this would prevent me from overstaying in areas that I feel Ive seen enough of.

I looked at a Eurorail (might have the wrong name here) pass that is unlimited use for 3 months for $1000 USD for 2nd class or $1300 USD for first class.

Would also jump on a regional airline if needed.

Budget is between $2200-3500 USD per month.  That would have to include lodging, transportation, a European eSim with data, food and entertainment.

Questions:
1) Is relying on the train a decent idea especially if I go to the Balkans?

2) Is the budget reasonable for lodging?  I prefer my own room and bathroom. Prefer to come in on the middle or lower end of the budget if possible 

3) Would booking lodging, trains, and activities on short notice be a financial bad idea?

4). Any other ideas, advice, or criticisms, would be appreciated

I'm planning to travel around Europe this summer. I'm on a rather tight budget (1k€ per month for up to 3 months), and will be traveling with camping gear to allow for outdoor stays. I will stay in hostels every once in a while as well.

I will most likely be on the move a lot, not staying in the same place for more than a couple nights. I'm particularly planning to travel through the British Isles, France, Benelux, Germany and the Alps, but will visit a select few locations in other parts of Europe as well if time and budget allow.

Here are my options for realizing my plans:

* Interrail Pass (3 months, 2nd class, youth ticket) - 717€
* Interrail Pass (3 months, 1st class, youth ticket) - 911€
* Individual tickets for train and bus + hitchhiking in suitable areas - ???€

What order is best? The one I have above? Or should I switch it up and go from North to South, or make Scotland be a middle stop?

1706475933.0,"Eurrail Pass Help - France, Switzerland and Italy","Hi everyone, 

I will be travelling in July and recently purchased a 5 day global Eurrail pass. I am starting to stress about my travel plans because when I have tried to make reservations through Eurrail, it shows no results for almost all the train routes I want to book. The following is the travel days we will be using the pass for: 

**Paris to Lucerne**

**Lucerne to Interlaken**

**Interlaken to Florence** 

**Florence to Naples**

**Naples to Rome** 

&#x200B;

 I had done my research and for example, know that eurrail covers Paris to Lyon or Paris to Basel and Basel to Lucerne. However, when I look these up through Eurrail it shows NO results. Similarly, it does not even show Florence to Naples or Naples to Rome as having an results when I search up the trip for my dates. I realize it shows online that Trenitalia is covered by the pass but the regional trains are usually not inputed into the Eurrail App, but I am completely confused as to how we can go about reserving trips that use Trenitalia. For example, when we will travel from Interlaken to Florence, we will need to transfer trains a few times so I need to ensure that we have all trains and their specific times set out before hand. 

With France, I am completely confused as to why Eurrail shows NO options available. It offered only one route to get to Lucerne which involved going all the way into Belgium and the Luxembourg. Yet, when I check on google, SNCF and Lyria trainlines both show routes between Paris, Lyon, Basel, Etc. I am totally lost on what to do and do not want to have to book separate tickets through SNCF to ensure we have reserved seats. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any input or advice on why this may be? I am hoping it is just a bit early and that more times will be released? I am stressed and worried that I wasted all this money on a pass we may not be able to use.

Thanks so much. ",Europetravel

Hello there folk! 

&#x200B;

This is my first time traveling through Europe with train and I've setup a little plan with some optional side steps if I get creative or just feel like it. Check the end for if you're open to give some advice!

&#x200B;

This is the travel plans that I've put up, and I think it's a good way to make it as cheap as possible and as enjoyable as possible!

Stockholm - Berlin (3 days stay)

Berlin - Prague (3 days stay)

Prague - Salzburg (2 days stay)

Salzburg - Verona (3 days stay)

Optional side track: Venice 1 day trip during the 3 day Verona visit.

Verona - innsbruck (Through bus, No stay in innsbruck)

Innsbruck - Paris (3 days stay)

Optional side track: Paris - Brussels (with bus, 3 days. Then bus to Amsterdam)

Paris - Amsterdam (with bus, 3 days stay)

Amsterdam - Hamburg (3 days stay)

Not sure if it's the best possible track to take to try and save as many travel days as possible for the longer distances that one travels, I think this is a great way to balance it out, especially the Paris to Amsterdam bus ride, it saves 14€ (yes not much but still) and a travel day to be able to optimize the amount of countries I can fit into the trip.

&#x200B;

So here comes the questions we all been waiting for!

1. Any tips on what events is happening in the cities (or places nerby mentioned cities) I've mentioned this summer (June-August) ?
2. Any advice on places to stay that's cheap and good quality?
3. Food tips and tricks, placed to eat out at and if possible cooking your own food!

I am currently planning a 2 month Europe trip (looking to go mid Aug to mid Oct) and am tossing up whether to book return flights (departure and return times are essentially locked in) or one way (slightly more expensive but provides flexibility if I want to extend / reduce). However, I have heard things that they may ask you if you have a return flight booked before they let you through.

I am coming from Aus, so will be flying into London, which I understand is not part of the Schengen area. So, will I still be asked this? Is it just safer and easier to have a return flight? What's your guys experience? Thanks.",Europetravel

1706482800.0,Advice for France and Western Germany Itinerary,"Hello! I will be traveling in Germany/France for \~3 weeks in July between the end of the EUFA Euros Championship and beginning of the Olympics.  I have a tentative itinerary and have booked hotels/airbnb in Paris/Cannes since things are booking very quickly, but it is all refundable until early July so happy to move around.

I have not been to Western Germany and have only been to France in the winter (mostly in the Alps, \~2 days in Paris).  I am flying into Dusseldorf or Cologne Monday, July 8th morning and flying out of Paris Saturday, July 27th evening.  There are a few events I am planning around:

* Euro Semifinal in Dortmund: Wednesday, July 10th at 3pm
* Bastille Day in Paris: Sunday, July 14th
* Olympics Football Match in Marseille (France's first match): Wednesday, July 24th at 9pm
* Olympics Opening Ceremony in Paris: Friday, July 26th evening

My biggest questions are (1) how much time to spend in the Rhine/Mosselle Valley and (2) how to split up time between Paris and the French Riviera.  I'll be using trains to get around and enjoy normal tourist highlights with an extra appreciation for nature.

&#x200B;

**Tentative Itinerary**

* **Cologne/Dusseldorf/Dortmund Region (July 8-10)**
   * July 8 - Fly in from Copenhagen Sunday (July 7) or Monday morning (July 8), drop off bags in Dusseldorf hotel (?) and explore the local area
      * Potentially go for afternoon to Essen or Gelsenkirchen? - probably too tight on July 8, maybe after Cologne on July 9 if it's a worthwhile trip
      * Also considering Cologne as a base since there's more to do but seems like that requires more train trips overall
   * July 9 - Day trip to Cologne: Cathedral, promenade, gestapo museum?; back to Dusseldorf hotel
   * July 10 - Day trip to Dortmund: Drop off bags in a locker near train station, explore city in the morning, 3pm Euro Semifinal Match
      * Expecting match to end by 5-6pm, grab dinner, and train to Koblenz for the night
* **Koblenz/Cochem/Luxembourg (July 10-13)**
   * July 10 - Arrive in evening at Koblenz hotel, explore locally or go straight to bed
   * July 11 - Explore Koblenz spend half a day in Cochem and other towns on river? (Rudesheim?), overnight in Koblenz
      * Not sure if this requires 1.5 days or how best to get around (take a boat instead of trains?)
   * July 12 - Continue exploring the valley (?) and take midday train to Luxembourg, walk around Luxembourg city and stay overnight
      * Is Trier worth a few hours on the way?
   * July 13 - Morning walking around Luxembourg City (not sure if there's enough in the city to fill a full day), midday train to Paris
   * If Rhine/Mosselle valley highlights only need 1 day then I would probably train to Luxembourg July 12th evening and take an extra day in Paris
* **Paris (July 13-18)**
   * Staying at hotel near Luxembourg Gardens, going out Saturday, July 13 upon arrival
   * No set plan besides Bastille Day (July 14), planning to try many boulangeries, people-watch in cafes, and visit the standard sites (Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, Trocadero, Musee d'Orsay, Louvre - don't need a full day here since I've been before, Musee d'Orsay, Montmartre, Luxembourg Gardens, etc.)
      * Think this is the only portion of the trip I don't need advice for what to do, think I can easily fill 4+ days, but I will take take recommendations!
   * July 18 midday train to Cannes
* **French Riviera (July 18-26)**
   * Staying in Cannes hotel July 18-24
      * Planning to take day trips to Monaco, Nice (+ Eze), and St Tropez
      * Otherwise just relaxing on the beach in Cannes, expect to be tired from a few months of traveling by this point (could add a day trip to Antibes if I have the energy)
   * Staying in Avignon July 24-26
      * Taking train from Cannes to Avignon July 24 morning to drop off bags, then train to Marseille
      * July 24 afternoon - explore Marseille before 9pm Olympics France football match; train back to Avignon after the match
      * July 25 - Explore Avignon, maybe see lavender fields
      * July 26 - Morning train to Paris
* **Paris Olympic Day (July 26-27)**
   * Opening ceremony July 26th night; go to a morning Olympic event July 27 then pickup bags from airbnb before evening flight

Vienna:  
\-For Vienna I am planning to visit the Dom and Kunsthistorisches Museum. Is there any other museums/places you would also recommend for someone who love historical architecture and classical art (music excluded)?  I will only have less than 3 days there (arriving in the morning on Sunday by NightJet and leaving by NightJet on Tuesday evening) so I hope to visit those worth visiting most first. I am expecting spending at least half day on the third day in the Kunsthistorisches Museum.  

\-For Kunsthistorisches Museum should I buy tickets in advance? and how early in advance should I buy tickets? Assuming I will be visiting on a Tuesday, preferably in the morning.

\-another question on entry tickets, are there other museums/sightseeing spots that you would recommend buying tickets in advance?

\-I will be visiting some cafes in Vienna too. I am planning to visit Demel, but is there any other cafes that are great?

\-I want to try schnitzel and apple strudel, and other traditional food too. Is there anything else that I should try? And where can I find good quality (preferably not too expensive) ones?  


Cologne:  
\-Any restaurants you would recommend for lunch that serves traditional cuisine of the region (and Kölsch too)?

\-I am planning to see the Römisch-Germanisches Museum (I am aware it has moved to a temporal location) and some of the roman structures in the city. Is there other historical buildings/structures (not necessarily roman) that are worth seeing? Given that this is the second time visiting Cologne (so I have seen the Dom and the area around the Rathaus) and I only have less than a day there (arriving early morning and leaving late afternoon).

\-about lugguage storage, does anyone have experience storing luggage at the Köln Hbf?

I've travelled extensively in France but haven't been west of Marseille in at least 15 years, and all cities on the line seem like good options so I'm looking for tips, recommendations and advice.

I'll be travelling with my gf (31F) and we don't plan on stacking activities, it's more than likely gonna be a chill day where we get there in the early afternoon and explore the city center, maybe do one activity (museum, historic building, etc.), have a nice dinner and leave for Marseille the next morning. We like architecture, culture, picturesque cities, modern art museums and understated restaurants.

Thanks to anyone who can help!",Europetravel

We want to pick the place with the BEST breath taking views.

Thanks 🙏

Update 🚨: wow, thank you all for so for such thorough comments and recommendations.  We are going with Dolomites ! Thought process below: 

- Iceland: consensus is that we need more than 5 days to get the best of it ! We will dedicate more time to it on a separate trip.

- Swiss Alps vs Dolomites: this was such a hard choice. On views alone,  it was almost a tie but based on our research (and us really nitpicking to try to decide on a place) we did like that Dolomites seems to have a more varied scenery compared to the Swiss alps. We are already trying to decide when we can visit the Swiss alps afterwards though because it looks stunning nonetheless.

How should we fill our time in Croatia? Things we'd love to do - swim, explore ruins, walk city walls,  visit old towns, island boat tour, caves, and Plitvice Lakes National Park. Probably wouldn't want to do any extreme sports like rafting, canyoning, or ziplines (my son and I do not like heights like that - but daughter and husband might)

We will be traveling with only a backpack each so will need to figure out laundry mid trip. Both kids are well traveled and grandpa is just along for the ride and down to do whatever.

Side note about renting a car - I don't think we can take rentals on the ferry? Not sure how to explore islands if that's the case.

Thank you all in advanced :)",Europetravel
1706162165.0,"France, Spain, Portugal, or...Italy??","Wife and I are planning a week long trip (our first to Europe) for mid April, and for as much research as I have done I can't seem to narrow down where I want to go much. Some of the things we like are food, bikeable cities, wine, history, architecture, castles, and beaches or rivers. Budget is important but we don't mind stretching our dollars to go to an unforgettable place. With it being a relatively short trip, we'd like to stick to 2 main cities and mix a day trip or two in. Some of my ideas are...

1.) France: Paris and Bordeaux, Lyon, or maybe Brussels via high speed rail

2.) Spain: No clue because there are a ton of cities to choose from. Bilbao and San Sebastian? Valencia or Seville and Madrid? Barcelona? They all seem nice.

3.) Portugal: Lisbon and Porto, or maybe one of those and a beach town

4.) Italy: Thought it would be out of budget but it might not be. I would have to fly into Venice or Milan and go from there though. I've never felt some huge desire to go there but it seems to always come up as a good destination so I could be convinced.

Thoughts or suggestions? General vibes of the listed countries? Anywhere I'm not thinking of but should? I appreciate any help I can get.",Europetravel
1706201163.0,Eurail Journey Help!,"So - me and my friends are Americans studying abroad in Europe this spring, and we have a week off for spring break in March where we plan on going from Paris, to Luxembourg, to Germany, to Sweden, to Denmark, and ending in Amsterdam. We think we wanna buy the 1 or 2 month pass so we can start it during this week long trip, and then continue to go on weekend trips from Paris while it’s still valid.

The problem is, I know there’s reservation fees, which vary in price and seat availability, which is fine. But, I want to get a head start on that. 

So, are we able to buy the pass now and then make reservations 2 months in advance, so that it starts the last week of March and ends in April/May, and we can have everything booked now and not have to worry about it?? Since we want to book some sleeper trains (Berlin to Stockholm, for example). Or do we have to wait to buy the pass and make reservations, because we don’t want it enabled now, we want it enabled in March, but we want to make our reservations!!

Sorry if that’s confusing, but I hope you get the gist. I’ve been doing research and either I’m stupid or nothing is coming up. I just don’t want to make any errors since it costs a lot of money!!",Europetravel

Currently planning a big trip to Europe (just under 3 months).

1706168733.0,Southern Switzerland / Northern Italy - where to go with 63yo Dad coming to Europe for the first time?,"I live in Zurich and my dad is coming to visit for a week at the beginning of March. He’s never been to Europe and the main thing he wants to do is go to the Beretta Factory in Gardone Val Trompia - near Brescia, Italy. I’m working on that and would like to make a nice 3-4 day trip out of it. 

He arrives Thursday morning March 7. I’ll show him around Zurich Thursday / Friday - maybe take him up the Uetliberg or on a day trip to a nearby hike if the weather is nice  

Saturday I’m thinking we can rent a car or take the train somewhere in the general direction of Brescia. 

Lugano / Como are at the top of the list currently - but not sure it’ll be the best place to go if the weather sucks. Would love suggestions of things to do or other places to consider. 

Monday or Tuesday we’d head to Beretta for the tour, if I can manage to get in. There’s also a museum I think he’d enjoy close by. I haven’t looked into other things to do in that area, but would probably want to spend another night or two rather than travel right back to Zurich 

About my dad: he is a huge hunter and sportsman, so outdoorsy in his own way but wouldn’t be interested in a 10k hike. I can’t imagine him being thrilled to walk around a city and window shop or walk through museums all day. He loves good food and wine.

1706124878.0,Scottish highlands - All your tips for renting a car safely and affordably please,"Hello Reddit,

My husband and I are planning on doing 4 days in the Highlands in early June. I'm looking for advice on what is the best way to go in terms of car rental? The plan would be to pick the car up and drop it off in Edinburgh and/or Glasgow. Is there a company/service that is known to be best or most economical (or both) in Scotland? Money definitely is an object for us XD.

When I was looking a few weeks ago I think I got quotes around €400 for basically the cheapest car you can get, for 4 days rental. Does that sound right? It's very expensive compared to car rental where I come from (almost 4x as expensive). I wanted to try do the highlands without a car, but I've been convinced by other posts in this sub-Reddit that this might make the experience a lot worse... Trains also seem to be insanely expensive to and from Glasgow/Edinburgh.

Any other advice related to this would also be greatly appreciated. E.g. Anything noteworthy about driving in the highlands? (apart from driving on the left side of the road - same in my country). Any tricks the car rentals play to watch out for? Best places for a home base in the highlands?

I'm looking for some advice/clarity on booking a sleeper car on the nightjet train from Amsterdam to Munich in June.

The only sleeper cabin options are triple or single. I have chosen triple since there are two of us and we can't afford single cabins each. We are fine with potentially having a third person in the cabin with us. However, on the OBB website at least, when I go to check-out, I get a message saying that the two people in the booking will be placed in separate cabins (see image).

Do passengers on the same booking get placed in different cabins, or is the error incorrect? Otherwise, have I done something wrong? Appreciate the insight from people who have travelled nightjet trains before.

1706017809.0,Late spring trip - is this too much?,"My husband, kid, and I will be traveling to Europe in early June to visit friends in Berlin and Geneva. I've never been to Europe and would love to see as much as possible but recognize that, realistically speaking, it'll be hard doing a ton of travel with a 15-month-old. We'll be spending a few days in Berlin and a couple days in Geneva... but I'd love to visit other locations as well and have sketched out a tentative plan.

Day 1: Depart from US west coast, arrive in Stockholm

Days 2-4: Sightsee in Stockholm

Day 5: Travel to Copenhagen by train

Days 6-7: Sightsee in Copenhagen

Day 8: Travel to Berlin by train

Days 9-11: Visit friends in Berlin

Day 12: Travel to Geneva by train

Days 13-14: Visit friends in Geneva

Day 15: Depart from Geneva back to US

We traveled to Japan for a couple weeks last fall and did a lot of travel on trains (local + shinkansen) with an 8-month-old kid, and things went pretty well. I do anticipate that kiddo will be walking by the time we arrive in Europe so it'll be good to have a space where they can get up to stretch their legs as we go from place to place.

When I think about it, this feels maybe like an aggressive plan - I know we won't get to see a ton in each place but am really interested in visiting a few different countries during our trip - so I wanted to touch base with folks here to see if it was unrealistic or might be really hard to do.

This will be our first time traveling to Europe so I need some help planning our trip. It would be my wife, my two teen kids, and myself. We’re going to be staying for 2.5 weeks and we’re flying out from Los Angeles to London. This trip would be happening in July.

My family and I really would love to visit London and Paris but other than that we don’t know what other cities to visit and stay at. Some of my ideas are:

- Strasbourg: I’ve heard that it is a nice city to stay at but don’t know if we would be able to stay there for more than two nights.
- Taking train to Switzerland: We would then go see places like Interlaken and Lucerne. Only issue is that it would mean a lot of time in a train and flying back to LA would be very expensive from Switzerland. 
- Taking train to Munich: This plan would be after Strasbourg and maybe stop at Heidelberg for one night. 

I would really like to do a round trip from London to keep the cost down. I was thinking after Munich or Switzerland I take a one way flight back to London and fly home from there. I would lose a day because I would have to stay at London for one night before my next flight. 

Please give me recommendations on these ideas. I know if I take a one way flight I would lose that day of exploring. We would love seeing historic cities with nice architecture and character. Thank you.

2-3 Travel to Saumur FR via train for some wine events, my wife works in wine so we are meeting friends. Spending the night there.

2-4 Travel Angers FR via train for additional wine events. Spending the night there.

2-5 Traveling from Angers all the way to Zurich which will be our longest day by train. I estimate this will be approximately 8 hours or travel. Angers to Paris is roughly 2.5 with all things included. Get out stretch, 25 minutes to Gare de Lyon from Gare Montparnasse, Paris to Zurich 4 hours.

2-6 We are traveling from Zurich to Chur (1.15 hr travel) to ride the Glacier Express from Chur to Brig. I have bought tickets far in advance.

Is it worth buying my train travel tickets in advance? We have a set travel itinerary in terms of where we are spending the night but the majority of the trains we are taking seem to be regular commuter trains that run regularly so not sure if its worth buying tickets in advance if they fill up or can I be flexible with the times of these.

We do have some specific things we want to go in Paris to but we are also trying to be realistic and not overbook ourselves. Should I be buying tickets in advance as well to museums and other attractions? Worried about locking in a time and having it hanging over us that we need to be somewhere by X time.

we are looking to go to museum d'orsay possibly Friday during the day when we arrive early and Louvre at night. We have heard that its possibly not busy during night time. But would it still be in our best interest to be buying tickets in advance?

Additional question on using Cell phone. I was looking at an Esim solution opposed to going through our carrier. Should I just bite the bullet and pay the $100 for my wife and I through the carrier?  


It is a lot of travel for the first chunk, but I figure a majority of the train travel is single train. Then we will arrive back in Paris and get to relax for the last 2-3 days.

Same answer probably goes for most planing to do London, Madrid, Paris, Rome on the same trip doing only a few days in any of those cities, even though the distances might be shorter...


Usually it would probably be more relaxing and you could enjoy a trip more if you stayed in ONE area.


Yes, I do get, that a lot of US americans don't get the chances to travel to Europe more than once or twice, but at least give yourself more than 1 day per City and add some rest days between traveldays...


Just to add some context about the distance involved: (heavily rounded)
London-Paris +/-470km (+/-290miles)
Paris-Madrid +/-1200km (+/-745miles) 
Paris-Rome +/- 1400km (+/-870miles)


Even if you do the sinful flying intercontinentaly in Europe (ImO flights below 800km should be banned outright), it's going to take almost a day to travel with all the connections to the airport, airport process and possible delays, if you go by train or car you're talking about between 8h to 24h depending on the route...


As an European I would focus on ONE or TWO countries max per Week.

I would love to stop at Antwerp station as it is very beautiful and understand the train from Ams will pass Antwerp before reaching Brussels. Is it possible if I stop at Antwerp, enjoy the station for some minutes, and then hop on the next train to continue to Brussels?

Day 10: plan to do day trip to Bruge and Ghent. Is there any Belgium pass similar to Netherlands? Or is there any cost effective way for the train and local public transport to visit both cities or just join the day tour as in Viator website?

Day 11 and 12: train to Paris (booked via omio/ eurostar). After arriving, plan to get the paris visite travel pass (covering zone 1-3)

Day 13-14: still in paris but getting the zone 1-5 as we will be visiting disneyland and use train to the airport to return home. 

General question: 

is seat reservation really a necessary for the international travel? We plan to choose the cheaper option ticket of the day, not the peak hour time. 

What happened if i miss my train during transfer due to delay?

1705593863.0,October in Southern Europe,"I'm getting married in late October in Florence. Can't wait. 

We have 10 days for a honeymoon, ending in Istanbul. We want to pop around Italy/Greece/Türkiye, and I'm having trouble figuring out what to include. I've been researching a lot, but I've never been to this part of Europe in October before and am having trouble finding results. My initial thought was to have an itinerary like Athens>Islands>Antalya>Istanbul, but I feel like it's the wrong season.

1. We would love a couple days of some lido/laidback beach club (music and service), but will any be open in late October anywhere across those three countries? Having a couple relaxing days is a must (to save us from our own desires to see everything we possibly can).
2. I know it's approaching the rainy/winter season in many places, but we would prefer to have nice weather. I was looking at Rhodes, for instance, and people say rain is often likely. Are there better areas (Puglia, Sicily, Crete, Greek Mainland?), or would I be better off spending more time in central/southeast Türkiye and skipping beaches/islands altogether? We are expecting good weather in Tuscany, but will have been there for a week already, and so we thought to leave Italy right away to see other things if it makes sense to do so.
3. Am I totally off track and should go somewhere else entirely in October?
4. We like being in places where bars and restaurants will be open in the evening, but aren't really looking to go clubbing on this trip.
5. to note, we've been to these three countries before, so I generally know what is possible (and what to beware of). Renting cars and driving manual is no problem/expected where needed. We'll definitely have 2 full days in Istanbul at the end. Very excited to eat all the things.",Europetravel

1705512241.0,Eurail Global Pass vs Swiss Travel Pass - looking for advise,"Hello, this is likely going to be a bit of a longer post, so I'll apologize in advance.  I tried figuring this out myself, but feel that I might be missing something.

My wife and I will be travelling to Europe this summer and I'm trying to figure out which is my best option: A 15 day SwissPass and extra tickets for Austria, or a 22 day Eurail Global Pass.

Our itinerary is as follows (Austria  6 days / Switzerland 15 days):  
Vienna (1 night)  
Salzburg (2 nights)  
Innsbruck (1 night)  
Zurich (2 nights)  
Como (1 night)  
St Moritz (1 night) Bernina Express  
Zermatt (3 nights) Glacier Express  
Montreux (2 nights)   
Thun (2 nights) Lake Thun/Lake Brienz boat & Golden Pass  
Bern (1 night)  
Zurich (2 nights)

We will be traveling exclusively by train, and as this will likely be a one and done, I would like to go first class.

Pricing (all pricing is for 2 adults):  
22 day Eurail Global Pass - 1488 Euro / $2183 (Canadian)

15 day SwissPass - $1446 CHF / $2264 Canadian  
(Austria Pass) Jubel-Vorteilspackerl - 200 Euro / $295  
VIE - Vienna - 10 Euro  
Vienna - Salzburg - 56 Euro  
Salzburg - Innsbruck - 47.50 Euro  
Innsbruck - Zurich - 95 Euro  
Total - 410 Euro / $600 Canadian  
Total with 15 day SwissPass Appox $2864 Canadian or $681 more than Eurail Global Pass.

From what I read travel passes in Zurich are between 14-30 Euro each (3 zone vs all zone - not sure of our needs just yet).  Travel passes can be had in the other cities we're visiting as well, but I have a hard time believing that we'll spend more than 437 Euro or $681 Canadian on those.

The free museums are nice, but I feel that we would only do them if we had nothing else going on.  None of them were on our 'must do' list.

From what I've read online, the Eurail Global pass will cover all of the trains I've listed.  I believe when we're in Zermatt or Thun there are other trains that the SwissPass will cover 50% of, and Eurail 25% of.

Is there something I'm missing, or does the Eurail Global pass fit my needs more than the SwissPass.

With the exception of the Bernina Express, Glacier Express, and Golden Pass where reservations are required, are they necessary on first class trains between the cities I've listed? In a 2x1 configuration, we like to sit on the side with the single seats facing each other.

1705506273.0,Christmas Trip - Belgium or Germany?,"Hi everyone! Our family of 4 adults is planning a Europe trip this coming December, and though it's still a couple of months away, we'd appreciate any suggestions that you may have about our itinerary. 

For context, this will be our second time in Europe as we recently visited last Christmas in Paris, Switzerland, and Italy. For this new trip, we're planning to go to Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin, and Prague. It will be for 14 days and will fall during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

Here's our plan so far:

3 days in Amsterdam

2 days in Brussels

3 days in Berlin

3 days in Prague

We're currently debating whether it's worth it to go to Brussels or just swap it altogether with another city in Germany as we're discovering that there are tons of beautiful cities to visit in the country as well. It will also lessen the travel time where instead of Amsterdam to Brussels, we'll go instead to a German city which is nearer to Berlin.

Do you guys have any thoughts regarding our concerns or would you recommend a new place that you think is worth visiting in lieu of Brussels? Or is Brussels a must-see? Also, Amsterdam and Prague are kind of not changeable anymore as this is where we're planning our flights. Our issue mainly lies in the in-between cities and number of days for each city.

As a family, we love to see architecture and historic landmarks. We also love to visit Christmas markets and maximize our time in winter activities as we come from a tropical country with no snow.

TLDR: My mom ""bought"" a bracelet from one of those guys in Rome, and really enjoyed the experience.

Whenever my parents travel to Europe, I walk through the typical scams (bracelets, beggars, bumps in crowds, petitions) and why wearing a money belt or not carrying large amounts of cash is important. The first time the went to Paris my mother listened to every word and lost nothing. My father, however, brought $1000 US cash, didn't put it in the money belt I gave him, didn't wear the money belt, AND gave 2 beggar girls a few small bills on the train from CDG into Paris. Well as he got off the train he felt a bump, the doors closed, and he check for his wallet to find it gone, along with all his credit cards and cash. Expensive lessons learned and great anecdotal story when I warn other people on valuable safety and environment awareness while traveling.

Each subsequent trip , I walk through the same ""keep your money safe"" conversation before they go. (They are NOT incompetent and are actually pretty well traveled, but scams and pickpockets sadly exist so I give them reminders).

They just got back from 2 weeks in Rome, London, Scotland. They spent 5 days in Rome and my dad tells me today as I pick them up at the airport: ""Your mom bought a bracelet of one of those guys you warned us about."".

My mother: ""He was a nice boy. I asked him if he was sending the money back home to help his family. He spoke great English and was super tall. Seemed like a really nice boy and he said he WAS sending the money back to help his mother. Besides it was only 5 euros...""

So were in Paris, it was our second day here. Like most tourists we were in awe of the Eiffel tower and wanted to see it again , so all things good we took the train from our hotel to Eiffel tower. As I was getting on the train , I asked my wife and kids to take the only available seats near us and I was standing near the doors. At this time three girls (maybe in their 20s) approached me and one of them started asking me whether this train went to a particular location. As they spoke in another language I just kept on saying I dont know look at the map. Still I didnt realise that this was an attempt to engage me in their talks while another one of them was making plans to pick pocket me.

Getting a bit annoyed I tried to  show her the train route and asked her to find her station, and suddenly I feel my wallet fall on the floor. Reality hit me and I panicked. Picked up my wallet and found 3 of my cards missing. I called my wife , and we started screaming at the girls that are you trying to steal from us. By this time a small crowd had gathered. Taking this opportunity I said that I am calling the police unless you return my 3 cards. They acted innocent , and suddenly one of the girls said conveniently that she found all my cards lying on the floor. So they were not there a moment ago.

Maybe they panicked, or realised I found what they were doing, but it ended fine. they all got down at the next station. To be safe, I locked those three cards for online transactions.

1698342599.0,I've been traveling around Europe this year and I have loved every bit of it except...,"How much people smoke and how little they care about non-smokers. 

I come from a country where it's forbidden to smoke in places where food is served regardless if it's an open space or a terrace (and trust me we're very far from being a developed country). If the place serves food, no smoking is allowed, period. And you will pretty much never see cigarette butts in the street. 

In every country I've been to people smoke everywhere. Some food places don't allow it inside but have a terrace where they allow it and people smoke in the door so the smell goes into the restaurant anyway. I can't say how many times we've had to leave before ordering or we've had to eat super fast to run away of how awful it is. And no one seems to care. I went today to this ice Cafe that has a no smoking sign in the entrance and turns out that they have the entire front of the place open to the sidewalk where they also have tables where people can smoke. The smell was so bad as if the next person was smoking. 

The streets are almost always full of cigarette butts and look a lot dirtier than they actually are.

1649862054.0,First time traveler to London/Paris last week,"As a first time Overseas Traveller (US citizen), and with all the restrictions and changes related to COVID, I thought maybe this post would be helpful to up and coming travellers to Europe (in particular London and Paris).

&#x200B;

My experience travelling to London and Paris with my Wife

&#x200B;

1. The flight and arrival: about 8.5 hours. Travelled with 2 carryon bags and one personal item. Did not check any luggage. Made moving throughout airports a breeze. Landed at Heathrow. All we had to do was scan our passports at automated machines. Never had human contact or went thru any type of customs to declare anything. Nothing COVID related was required to be shown to anyone (ex: negative tests/vax cards). Pre-purchase tickets for Heathrow Express, which is a non-stop train to London; I'd say about 15 minutes or so into the city. 

&#x200B;

2. Heathrow Express: This was our first experience with London public transport and right out the gates was confusing. There was a Heathrow Express and a Heathrow Local running on the same track. The Local is a train that makes numerous stops before reaching the end of the line and takes much longer. There is a human trying to direct travellers into the right train, but that only goes so far. Listen and look and don't be afraid to ask. We watched as a husband and wife came up, the wife hopped onto the train, the husband hesitated and asked a bystander if this was the Express, the train doors closed with his wife on the Local and left as he was pounding on the doors. Assuming they never seen each other again, lol.

&#x200B;

3. Underground: DO NOT BUY AN OYSTER CARD. They are not neccessary. Contactless payment is accepted at all stations. We used our phones EVERYWHERE. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the Underground. Stations are named, not numbered. Multiple lines run on the same station. The names of the trains didn't always make sense to us, but once we understood that the last stop on the line was listed on the train, we had an easier time knowing which direction we were heading. Also, it was very quiet on the trains.

&#x200B;

4. Cash: Exchanging dollars or going to an ATM is not necessary. We used contactless payment EVERYWHERE. Specifically our phones. Unlike the USA where some places just don't use it, Apple-pay and contactless was universal.

&#x200B;

5. Hotel: We stayed at a Travelodge 3 minutes from the Algate underground stop. About $90 a night. Walked to the Tower Bridge in 10 minutes. Super convenient. When looking for hotels, there are deals, but try to find a hotel near transit or near things you want to do.

&#x200B;

6. Rental cars: We rented a car thru Budget. Not too expensive. Most rentals are manual transmission, so be aware if you need an automatic. They did not take our International Licenses, just our State Drivers License. They drive on the left side of the road in the UK, but its pretty easy getting used to it. I just found my wife and I riding the shoulder/curb a lot. We drove to Stonehenge and Bath (totally worth it for both). 

&#x200B;

7. Walking: We walked nearly EVERYWHERE. Since they drive on the other side, you must be mindful when crossing streets. You'll notice ""LOOK RIGHT"" markings on the road, as reminders. Just be careful. As for pedestrians, its chaos out there. I feel like, in the US, we all pretty much walk on the right. Drive on the right, walk on the right, right? When entering/exiting the Underground, there are marking reminding you to walk up or down the left set of stairs. Drive on the left, walk on the left, right? Wrong. Once you get on the sidewalks it is a free-for-all. All day just coming up to passersby confused, doing crossover sidesteps like Kyrie Irving breaking ankles out there. Frustrating, but that's just the way it is.

&#x200B;

8. Free stuff: So much free stuff to do. We did the Natural History Museum (good), Tate Modern (ok), Sky Garden (fine) for free. Many more museums are free. It is a good idea to reserve ahead of time.

&#x200B;

9. Food: We ate a lot (as we like to do on vacation). Overall, we found the traditional English items to be underwhelming. Pie and mash, bangers and mash, chips and most Indian Food on Brick Lane was disappointing. But there was good stuff to be found. We enjoyed Afternoon Tea at the Woseley (and at $33 per person, a good deal). Dishoom in SOHO was great (might need a reservation). The fish portion of Fish & Chips was typically good. Borough Market is a must, we did a full English breakfast there (Maria's) and ate raclette at Kappacasein (so good). Cafe de Nata had awesome Porteguese tarts. Sunday roast at Blacklock was okay. As a note, if you are a fan of Tikka Masala, the UK version is an entirely different beast, not as creamy and veryyy sweet.

&#x200B;

10. Service: I felt like there was a certain, for a lack of a better word, shyness with Customer Service. Generally very friendly, but kind of indifferent. Especially with servers at restaurants. You'd be greeted and shown a table, with a menu. It may take a while for the server to come back and take your order. The food was freshly made everywhere, no problems there. There is no checking in while you eat. No ice, no straws with drinks. When you are finished, you will need to flag down your server and ask for ""the bill"". They will bring the check, but may not come back for a while to take payment. Just be patient and friendly. Again, everyone seemed very nice though. Also, Saturday was VERY BUSY everywhere. Many things are closed on Sundays.

&#x200B;

11. The sights/sites: All of the famous sights are totally worth seeing. House of Parliament, Tower Bridge, Stonehenge, etc are quite amazing to behold. I can't think of anywhere in the US that felt like Europe. We took a CityCruise down the Thames, which allowed for nice angles/pics of many famous London architechture. We went to a Championship level Football match, which was fun. 

&#x200B;

12. Safety: Not once did we feel unsafe. In fact, the city was impeccably clean. The Underground was spotless. No homeless or begging. No scams. I'm originally from NY, so I was stunned by how ""sterile"" London felt. But not in a bad way.

&#x200B;

13. Eurostar: We took the high speed train to Paris out of St. Pancras in London. Real easy to get to, took less than 30 minutes to get through passport control. You do not need any COVID related documentation. Passport agent checks your passport then you wait to board your train. Clean, comfortable, fast. Our tickets were less than $80 each.

&#x200B;

Paris

&#x200B;

1. Eurostar: Arrived at Gare du Nord. This is north of the center of Paris, in the 10th arrondissement. Right near famous Montmarte. You exit your train and you are in Paris, nothing to declare, no checkpoints or anything to go through. 

&#x200B;

2. Hotel: We stayed at an awesome little Hotel in the 17th, Hotel Darcet. Under $90 a night. It was 2 minutes from the Place de Clichy Metro station, 15 minutes walking from Gare du Nord. Walked past Montmarte, the famous Moulin Rouge and Sacre Coeur. The family there spoke fluent English, however they asked me if I wanted to comminicate in French. We did a little bit of both. Patient and friendly.

&#x200B;

3. Language: In fact, I found the people of Paris patient and friendly all the way around. Especially if you try to speak French with them. I've done perhaps a 150 days of Duolinguo, Coffee Break French podcast in the car, Learning French with Alexa on Youtube. I can pronounce and form simple sentences, especially when ordering food (lol) but I can really struggle with understanding French spoken to me. For example, my gal at the hotel would speak slowly to me, which helped immensely, but would help in English is she saw me confused. Servers were the same. I'd be all ""Bonjour, une table pour deux, s'il vous plait"" and they might come back with some speedy French and if I didn't catch it, they'd repeat in English. I'd typically try to order using French, and if I tried they'd light up, giggle, compliment me on pronunciation. It was so pleasant. Still, I'd say 95% of Parisiens speak good English.

&#x200B;

4. Transport: The Metro can seemingly get you anywhere. You can't use contactless payment like your phone. You have to puchase tickets or a navigo card. The metro is clean and probably a tad bit easier to understand than the London Underground. However, the trains get PACKED. Very small trains, with less cars than most mass transit systems. Bike lanes are everywhere. We rented Lime and Tier foot scooters for the first time and felt super comfortable going all over the city with them. Finally, I had read that taxis to the airports are price contolled at 37 euros. We took a taxi to Orly and it was, in fact, 37 euros.

&#x200B;

5. Smoking: Boy do the French like to smoke. Walking down the street, standing in line at a restaurant, sitting at the bistro. If you are sensitive to smoking, you may wish to sit inside at cafes and bistros. 

&#x200B;

6. Cash: Again, we used contactless payments everywhere. We did not use cash once on this trip.

&#x200B;

7. Sights: What a beautiful city. The architechture is amazing. The Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur, Invalides, Pont Alexandre, the Louvre, Versailles is only about 30 minutes away by train. All worth it. If you go to the Louvre, have a plan, as it's packed with art and people and kind of chaotic. 

&#x200B;

8. The food: Amazing. There are Boulangeries or Patisseries or Bistros or Cafes on every block. Boulangeries/Patisseries vary in quality, but there was usually something interesting or good and cheap at each one. One of our favorite things was a baguette from M'Seddi with some salted butter. Delicious. There's a road, Rue de Montparnasse, that is strictly restaurants that serve crepes and their savory cousin, the galette. 

&#x200B;

9. Safety: Totally safe. There was some homeless/begging going on and people trying to get you to sign petitions. But even walking the streets at night were fun and exciting and not dangerous or intimidating at all.

&#x200B;

Getting back home

&#x200B;

So, we took a taxi to Orly. We tried an Uber first, but they cancelled repeatedly. Honestly, at 37 euros, why not take a taxi? To get back into the US, you must have a negative COVID test within 24 hours of your flight. Do not do what we did, which is do an online COVID test with a virtual doctor. The attendant at check-in did not accept that result. We had to rush to the pharmacy in the airport, in line with 20 other people. That kid worked his butt off to get us swabbed. Results were ready  in 15 minutes. We also had to have a COVID app for our layover country (SPAIN). And a CDC form for the USA. My suggestion, just stop at any pharmacy the day before and get the test. They checked our passport in Paris, checked it twice in Spain on our layover and checked our COVID result a few different places, and finally checked our passports in the US. That day was the only stressful part of the trip.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I hope some of this helps folks that have questions about upcoming trips outside of the US. Bon voyage!",Europetravel

1627326933.0,My experience with France’s health pass requirements as an American,"I am an American who has been visiting Paris this week, in the immediate aftermath of the beginning of the health pass requirements. I found out about the health pass just two days before leaving for Paris, and just one day before it was to begin. Like many others I was confused and concerned that I would be unable to receive a health pass with my American CDC vaccination card. In all my searching (Google, Reddit, Twitter) before I left, no concrete solutions stood out to me at all. Nevertheless I came to Paris to see the sights, armed with my flimsy CDC card and a hope that I would either figure out how to get a health pass, or that my flimsy CDC card would be enough.

Having seen a bunch of the big landmarks in the last few days I can say this for sure: your CDC card is likely enough. I have visited the Catacombs, the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, the Pantheon, and more, and they all were just fine when I presented my CDC card. Some of them glanced at it and sent me on my way without a second thought, others took it from me to look at it  more closely (one of the ladies at the Arc de Triomphe especially made a big show of inspecting it and holding up to the light to make sure it was authentic) but they all let me through fine. None of them so far have asked for my ID to go with it but I had it on me just in case.

We are doing more sights in the next few days, so I can update this post with more experiences but I expect that I will be able to get into them just fine.

So, if you are an American traveling to Paris and you are stressed about the health pass, like I was before I left, here is concrete proof that your CDC card will work, or at least that it worked for me, though I’ve also witnessed it work for many others around me. I hope others who are stressed about it for an upcoming trip to France find this post and that it eases their worried mind, because if I had found something like this, I would have been significantly less stressed in the final days before my trip.",Europetravel
1703820764.0,What city to pair with trip to Prague?,"My mother and I plan to visit Prague from the US in February and I would like to visit another city while we are over there.

I've been to Europe several times growing up, but my wife has not been. However, she isn't interested in standing in line to see museum's and cathedrals. She is wanting more of a experience of strolling through the town, popping in shops and cafes, eating good food, enjoying the atmosphere, and relaxing. As opposed to the stress of trying to hit all the tourist 'hot spots' in each place. 

That being said I'm trying to put together an itinerary with places like Colmar, Freiburg, cinque terre, she wants to visit some Greek Islands, I'm also considering Edinburgh, and Bruges. 

I understand you can walk the streets of any great European city and just forego the typical sight seeing. But, the larger cities are much more crowded, and more expensive. 

So I suppose my official question is, what are some great towns that we could visit that aren't the typical 'tourist hot spots' but also still have the infrastructure (easy access by train, hotels, restaurants, shops, etc) to justify a visit.

We definitely should have been more careful with the tickets but during the time we talked to them we saw 6 other people stopped for the same reason, so it seems like a pretty common occurrence. I’m guessing they keep it intentionally confusing to take advantage of tourists and generate revenue.

We just wanted to know whether our proposed itinerary sounds reasonable, and if there's any general knowledge we should be aware of before we commit to any place in particular.

* Fly into Paris
   * 3-4 nights in Paris
* Train to Bern
   * 4 nights in Bern
   * Travel to surrounding villages and mountains
* Train to Rome/Naples?
   * 7 nights in Italy, not sure the exact plan but we'd love to visit Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast if possible
* Train to (eventually) Lisbon

1650914871.0,My Experience with Covid Requirements in Italy & Spain as a US Citizen,"I just returned from a 2 week honeymoon in Italy and Barcelona, and leading up to it, I was glued to this sub to figure out what exactly was required of me to bring as a US citizen for Covid. So I figured I should share my experience.

The majority of my trip was spent in Italy, and to enter Italy, you need your CDC vaccination card OR proof of recovery OR negative covid test. Any of the 3 will suffice, but if you decide to show a test, you'll have to keep getting tested every few days. You also have to submit an EU Passenger Locator Form. I flew with American Airlines and submited these documents through the Verifly app, and once I got to Passport control, i Just showed them my passport and that was it. No need to produce hard copies of the documents or show on my phone.

Within Italy, the CDC vaccination card will work as a Super Green Pass equivalent, so don't worry about that. If you dine indoors, you will also have to show your CDC vaccination card, but you won't be asked for it if you dine outdoors. Most places were diligent about checking the date of the last vaccination too. The boosted date is valid indefinitely. Masking is required indoors everywhere, and at high density tourist attractions like museums, they will enforce the FFP2 mask requirement. We brought KN95s from the US and had no issues with them.

From Italy, we flew to Spain and before arriving, you have to download their SpTH app and fill in another form with your vaccination info. After we landed in BCN, we went straight to luggage pickup without having to go through Passport Control since we came from another EU country. At luggage pickup is where officials scanned your SpTH QR code. After that, it was almost as if Covid restrictions weren't a thing. Wearing masks was rare anywhere except mass transit and we were never asked for our vaccination record again.

To re-enter the US, I took an antigen Covid test arranged by my hotel. It was 55 EUR and in hindsight, I wish I had brought a self-test kit from the US that you can take supervised by someone online, it would've been much cheaper. My wife submitted her documentation of recovery, which had to be shown at check-in, and the ticketing agent was very thorough in reviewing it. So definitely have everything covered: clear original positive test, dates, name matches passport, and all that.",Europetravel

We booked tickets well in advance using the Rail Europe site, this looked legitimate and we didn’t initially see any negative reviews indicating otherwise. Safe to say we were surprised to learn, when we tried to get on the train, that our tickets were not actually valid. The attendants informed us that Rail Europe is indeed a fraudulent site. Fortunately the DB staff were fantastic and we were able to purchase tickets directly from them for that train on the spot, but we had planned our entire trip using Rail Europe tickets, so had to re-plan and re-purchase multiple trips. I am still working with them to advocate for a refund but they continue to gaslight me into believe they’re a legitimate organization. Please learn from our experience and don’t use this site! Additional information that’s supported my assumption that this is a fraudulent company: 

1. The train staff themselves shared that this is a scam. 
2. There is not a phone number for this site.. a travel site that doesn’t have a phone number 🫠 
3. There is no Google page for this site, they wouldn’t want reviews to be accessible.

1671919821.0,Tips for travelling between Amsterdam and London,"Hi everyone. First time poster here. I’ve been travelling frequently between the Netherlands and London for about a year now (around once per month). I thought I’d share some tips from my experience, to keep your journey’s smooth, and help you get compensation if something goes wrong. 

**Eurostar**

* *Book early.* This is a much more pleasant way to travel, however, you need to book early. Think about any journeys you're expecting to do in the next half a year. If you end up not needing to go on the trip, you can change it for free up to a week before your departure date. Put a reminder of this in your phone calendar. The price difference between booking early and booking late is huge. 

&#x200B;

* *Always screenshot your ticket.* This means you have the ticket number as well as your booking reference. If you leave your ticket in your apple wallet, or on the Eurostar app, the ticket will eventually expire, removing the ticket number from view. If you ever want to claim compensation, for a delayed or cancelled train, you NEED this number. You’ll only be able to find the number again if you call Eurostar, however, the phone lines no longer exist and you’ll go in circles..you get the gist.

&#x200B;

* *Download your ticket early.* I don’t have any concrete evidence on this, only that when I’ve been slow, for example, I’ve only downloaded my ticket at the station, on a few occasions, it hasn’t let me download it on my phone. Instead, I’ve had to go talk to an employee at the Eurostar desk, and wait for them to print a physical ticket. Once this delay nearly caused me to miss my train. My hunch is that this could be due to the train being overbooked. 

&#x200B;

* *Travel in the week.* Run for that last 18.57 train (from Amsterdam) in the weekdays, it will be much quieter, and therefore a more pleasant journey than travelling on the weekend. 

&#x200B;

**Plane from Schiphol Airport**

* *Be careful if you have booked your flight ticket far in advance*. If a flight is overbooked, you are the first one to be kicked off the plane (as you have paid the least for your ticket). If you are unable to download your boarding pass after checking in online, or check-in tells you to pick your boarding pass up at the gate, GO STRAIGHT TO THE GATE. Sometimes they will only let 'overbooked' passengers on the plane in a first-come-first-served basis. Be specifically wary of KLM who kicked 4 of us off a flight late a Sunday evening for this exact reason. 

If anyone has any other travel tips please feel free to share them.",Europetravel

2.  At check-in, showed passport with my COVID vaccination card, although I don't think he cared too much about the card.  He cared more about the EU locator QR code/e-mail.

1631668403.0,Just sharing our recent 10 day Itinerary/experience in Ireland,"Hey all! I followed this sub pretty closely prior to our trip to Ireland  and wanted to give an update what the experience was like during these times with a quick summary of our itinerary:

Sept 3-4 Dublin. Explored Dublin Castle and walked around the town a lot. Also visited the St Patrick's Cathedral. 

Sept 5, drove to Kilkenny and went inside Kilkenny Castle (fun visit!). Also visited the St. Mary Medieval Museum which was ok. Stayed the night in Kilkenny.

Sept 6, drove to Black Rock Castle, Cahir Castle and Rock of Cashel. Stayed the night in Cork and had breakfast at the English Market the next day.

Sept 7, drove to Blarney Castle (such a fascinating interior!), then parked at Carignass Castle to walk/hike 30 minutes to Kealkill Stone Circle. Stayed the night in Killarney.

Sept 8, from Killarney, we drove the Ring of Kerry. Amazing drive, seeing all the nice views and making lots of stops. Highlights included the Cliffs of Kerry and the Gap of Dunloe. Then came back to Killarney for the night. Total trip took about 7-8 hours (around 3.5 hours pure driving). 

Sept 9, drove to Cliffs of Moher and then the Doolin Cave (ticket times are strict). Stayed the night in Galway. 

Sept 10, drove to Trim Castle Keep then went to the Carlton Hotel near the Dublin Airport for our Antigen test (make an appt. asap if you go this route). Test was a drive thru nose swab and the result was emailed to us within 10 minutes. We then printed the results at our hotel in Dublin where we stayed till Sept 12.

Everything went smoothly, lots of outdoor seating. To eat inside, they requested to see your CDC card. Nothing required to eat/drink outside. Also, dont forget to complete your Passenger Locator Form prior to departure. Coming home we just showed our Covid negative test at the Dublin Airport. 

Lots of castles were free to visit since they closed off certain parts due to covid. Even though it was free, you still needed to schedule your times. So plan ahead.

If you haven't driven a right-hand drive car before, the roads in the countryside or towns can be tough. Super narrow roads. I have experience with driving in Scotland and NZ, so it wasn't too bad for me. The Gap of Dunloe was the hardest with how narrow the roads were, but just have a good co-pilot to see how close to the edge you're driving. If you want to drive slow, pull over and let the others behind you pass. Don't be that guy (the most frustrating part of driving there was being stuck behind a slow driver). Also if you're renting and you have rental insurance with your credit card and want to bypass their required insurance, some facilities in Ireland may require proof of credit card insurance so be prepared.

If you use Yelp/Google often when looking for a restaurant, have a back up restaurant when heading to one you choose. Lots of restaurants were temporarily closed or closed early and were not updated. Or call ahead. Also menus were sometimes limited compared to pre-covid.

Credit card was preferred by most establishments with the quick tap to pay. We didn't use any cash the entire time which was convenient. 

One last advice that I wish I knew: bring bug spray and anti-itch ointment. If you attract mosquitos like me back home, you'll become a buffet meal at the Cliffs of Moher, Cliffs of Kerry and Gap of Dunloe. Instead of mosquitos there, I had swarms of gnats feasting on me. Called biting Midges there. Super itchy bites but only last about 3 days. 

It was an amazing trip with great sceneries and friendly people. Definitely recommend! Wish we had more time to spend in towns, but you know, limited vacation days. Feel free to ask me anything.

I am travelling to Europe with my mother and sister in 3 weeks. We are going with a travel agency, and our entire trip is paid in advance: flights, hotels, meals, sightseeing, etc. The only expense we might incur there will be in the form of personal shopping. 

We will be visiting Paris, Switzerland, and Italy over 11 days. 

This is our first international trip, and we are not sure how much cash we should carry in hand. We want to do the currency exchange here in India where we live, instead of at the airport or ATMs there. 

We are considering around 500-600 Euros. Will that be sufficient? We won't shop a lot, just some small stuff and souvenirs.

1664386187.0,going to prison?,"Hey everyone, I need serious help. I have VERY unintentionally overstayed my tourist visa by 3 months here in Germany (us citizen) and now I don't know how to proceed, what do i do? What type of attorney/lawyer do i need? 
Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!

Full story: 
I originally arrived in Germany on 2/18/22 then left on 5/06/22. I then came back to Germany on 
6/22/22 and have been here since because I was getting a logistically supported on the air base so I could stay permanently. Well when I went to do paperwork for the job offer I had accepted, they told me they could no longer higher me because my visa was expired (and far beyond expired at that) thats when we found out that just because you leave the country it does NOT mean your 90 days resets. My boyfriend and I were very unaware of this. Apparently I had time left (13 days) on my tourist visa which is how I was able to get back into the country. When I went through customs, they asked how long I intended on staying, I replied ""at least 3 months, but hopefully permanently"" they stamped my passport and sent me on my way. I've been doing a ton of research because I am extremely lost on how to proceed. I had heard there are visa extension options but typically only if your visa is still valid OR if there was some serious medical condition. I'm about 1 week away from having overstayed my visa be an ENTIRE 90 days. Here is where the concern of prison comes in, I read that if you try to fly back to your home country you'll technically be engaging in illegal activity as this is an attempt to ""flee the country"" youll detained immediately and guaranteed to be sentence prison time. Obviously I don't plan on going about it that way, my first choice is to see if I have ANY options for some sort of extension. If not then my next plan is to get an attorney and turn myself in. I've also read that in typical cases overstating by around 14 days us punishable by a large fine or 1 year imprisonment with up to a permanent ban. 30+ days is punishable by 1(up to10) year imprisonment with up to a permanent ban. Basically the longer your overstay the more severe your punishment, well that is exactly what has me so scared because I've overstayed by almost an entire 3 months. What can/should I do? How do I proceed?

In my feels: I'm also really sad/scared at the thought of not being able to see my boyfriend for an unknown amount of time. I've never done long distance because I've always said i could never handle it, I don't think he could handle long distance either. I don't want to lose him because of this, I can whole heartedly say he is the best thing to have happened to me in many years. I cant even begin to go into all the ways hes helped me improve my life.

1688291187.0,Shiling Poprad - Slovakia,"Hey guys.

I wanna give a bit of attention for a place located less than a hour from several natural beauties in Slovakia. 

Poprad in itself is not that interesting place, but it is exactly between/close to 3 Slovakian National parks, which can all be considered as hidden gems - that is Vysoké Tatry, Nízké Tatry and Slovenský ráj. Ideal destination for people appreciating nature.

Vysoké Tatry are the highest mountain range of Carpathian mountains, with its highest peak Gerlachovský štít (2655 meters). One of the reasons they are quite special is their prominence. Directly underneath them is a valley at approx. 700 meters above sea level altitude. There are no other peaks obstructing the view from the valley to the highest mountain tops, so the view is incredible. The beginnings of the hiking trails can be easily reached from Poprad via an electric train. I think there are 7 peaks accessible by well-signed tourist trails, rest of them is reachable with tour guides only. However the 7 is quite enough for even longer stays and the payoff at the tops is usually breathtaking (fingers crossed for no fog). This [video](https://youtu.be/wTq3E1hU4uQ) showcases what to expect, although I wouldn't recommend anyone to take the path this guy took.

I understand that high mountain hiking isn't everyone's cup of tea, especially since some of these trails have quite exposed parts, which can make you dizzy. If you are nature enjoyer, but don't want to go to the more extreme side of things, High Tatry got you covered too - you can opt to visit some of the mountain lakes, called ""pleso"" in Slovakia, such as [Velké Hincovo pleso](https://images.app.goo.gl/vSCNrMqhjWYi7hWG9) or [Zelené pleso](https://images.app.goo.gl/FNAkAtBXfnFffnwCA). Another option is to visit a mountain hut and have a lunch or a coffee with nice view there. Final non-trekking possibility is to take a [cable car](https://www.vt.sk/en/resort/resort-info/cableway-trips/lomnicky-peak) to the top of Lomnický štít (2634 meters I think) and take in the view. However, you will probably have to book the ride in advance and pay a substantial amount of money.

Leaving the High Tatry, there is another national park right across the wide valley, Nízké Tatry. ""Nízké"" can be translated to short or small, but contrary to that, the mountains are not small at all with the highest peaks higher than 2000 meters. Here, one day treks are very much possible, but I would suggest taking a different approach - crossing the whole range on foot, while sleeping in mountain huts, which Slovaks call ""útulna"". The trek starts in Telgárt and ends in Donovaly and can be taken in both directions. It will take you circa 5 days. One thing which should be said is that there is not really any opportunity to resupply your food on the trail, however it is possible to buy a fresh warm meal in the huts.

Other then the treks, there is at least one more thing worth visiting in the park and that are the caves, especially those in Demänovská dolina - [Demänovská ladová jeskyna and Demänovská jeskyňa Slobody](http://www.ssj.sk/en). In the warm months of summer this can be a welcomed change of climate too.

The final national park is slovenský ráj. Iam not as familiar with this one as with the others, but I know that the biggest attractions here are the ascends up through the valleys, called 'doliny'. Earlier this year, I've hiked up the Sokolia dolina. The highlight of the hike is a passage on series of chains and ladders, taking you up a Waterfall called Závojový. Its high is 75 meters, making it the second highest waterfall in Slovakia. Iam also pretty sure that there are some caves in the area of the park, but I could be wrong.

Finally, in a case that there is a bad weather, or you are just feeling like simply relaxing for a day or two, there are a few thermal pools in a close proximity, as well as a huge [aquapark called Tatralandia](https://www.tatralandia-aquapark.cz/). We've visited [Bešeňová](https://www.besenova.cz/termalni-koupaliste/) in the past during a particularly rainy day, and the warm mineral water really soothened out moods. It's also worth mentioning that Slovakian official currency atm is EUR.

I suppose there would be way more to add about the possibilities there, but I feel like I've successfully picked everything which was on my mind for now, also I've started typing this at the end of April and look where we are now lol. I hope someone down the road will find this wall of text helpful",Europetravel

1614882288.0,Europe for two weeks in May '22... Are travel agents still a thing?,"Hello.  My wife and I are in our late 40s (I will turn 50 right before our trip) and my daughter will be almost 13.  We have all been scrimping and saving for 3 years, and finally are good to go financially (barring a crisis) on our trip.  Two weeks in the second half of May, 2022.  So about 15 months from now.

Here is my main question... Are travel agents still a thing?  My wife and I did two weeks on our honeymoon, 15 years ago, in Dublin and London.  And we found - at that time - that we were still able to save some money by booking through an agent.  At least the hotels and main airfare.  However, I am not sure that is still the case?

Secondly, we are not 100% yet on our itinerary; we are still enjoying window shopping.  And I wonder if an agent might be able to help us shape those opinions.  But boy, it is proving hard to find someone.

Here is what we do know:

* We live in St Louis Missouri; no direct flights to Europe.
   * I am leaning extremely heavily towards flying on Virgin for the crossings.  Maybe going through Atlanta?
   * Fair chance we will upgrade to Premium Economy
   * We have a butt-load of SouthWest air points saved, but do not see a way to use them
* A week in London is extremely likely.
   * Another week somewhere in Europe is also likely.  The current candidate is Crete, but still much discussion around this.
   * Maybe a side day trip to Paris from London

So lots of questions on how to do things, maximizing our value or efficiency, insider secrets, etc.  But who to ask.  Or should we be doing it all ourselves, with advice from our reddit friends?

1697974373.0,Read the fine prints if you don't want to get fined when travelling in Budapest (and Prague too),"
TLDR. There are so many ticket options for the public transport in Budapest (owned by BKK): single ticket, single ticket on the spot, 30-min ticket, 60-min ticket and 1 to 3 day travelcards. We got fined because we thought a single ticket would take you to anywhere within the city limit but little did we know that transferring was not allowed for single ticket. Also you have to buy a ticket for your luggage when using the Prague public transport if you don't have a travelcard. Plain clothes conductor would take every opportunity to make sure the tourists learn their lessons.

EDIT: besides the element of venting, the purpose of this post is to let others aware that different cities have different rules in their transportation systems. So read before you travel, especially if you are an Europe first-timer on a multi-city trip.

Full Story: 

We needed to go to Szetendre which was just outside Budapest. Now we have read all the stories saying if you travel from Budapest, Szentendre is outside the city limit so you will have to buy a supplement ticket if you have the travel pass. So we did that and bought the supplement. However we only bought a single ticket and not the travel pass because that day we were mainly travelling outside Budapest so there was no point to buy a travelcard.

As soon as the train passed the city boundary, the train conductor (who successfully blended in as a local previously with t-shirt and jeans) announced his presence and decided to check the tickets for everyone that looks like a tourist. 

First the Italian family of 3 fell victim because they only had the travel cards but did not buy the supplement. Of course the father was saying he didn't know but that was not good enough, so he was fined on the spot. (The train conductor was like a broken record repeating you would have to pay for the fine because you did not have the right ticket, regardless of whether it was intentional fare dodge or simply because of ignorance) 

Next he came to us and of course i showed him the supplement tickets that we bought, then he checked on our single tickets and then smiled. It turned out that I needed 2 single tickets because i have changed lines (from M2 to H5) in between. 

Only at that moment did I know that single tickets are fine for a single destination within Budapest as long as you don't transfer between lines (yet you are ok to change lines within metro). If I bought time-based ticket then i would be fine!

Needless to say I got fined too.  We never intended to dodge any ticket fare but ignorance costed us 25 times a single ticket. (And no, there was no single ticket on the spot!) 

""Luckily"" the fine was not much compared to Western Europe, but at least when i lost my ticket in UK (on train, I suspect I was pick pocketed), the British Rail conductor let me off as I showed i had bought a return ticket. In the country where I live we would usually get warning unless we are intentionally dodging the fare (e.g. Use discounted ticket without proof), besides there is something called a ticket gate that would not let you go past when you don't have a valid ticket when transferring in the first place.

Lastly, the train conductor stopped checking other people after seeing the rest looked like local people (and maybe he already met his quota of the day).

Today I still do not understand the logic:
If a 30-min ticket allows transfers why does a single ticket not allow? 
If a single ticket allows transfers within the metro, why does it not allowed to transfer between bus/tram/train? (they all run by the same company)
Sometimes to get to a place you really need to transfer between the lines. 

Lastly do these conductors get a commission for every fine?

1696259712.0,considering making my big europe trip this winter - terrible idea? should i just wait for the summer?,"hi everyone hope y'all are having a great day!

so im an american college student, and because I haven't really had a chance to study abroad, i thought it might be fun to go on a europe trip this winter break with some of my european friends.

i wanted to make the most out of the (fairly pricey) transatlantic flight, so my exploring as much as I reasonably can is definitely a priority. generally, what I'm looking forward to are museums (i like art & history!), historical places, great sights, and just interesting experiences in general (i like food nom nom). natural beauty is also great, and if I can get to see that, that'd be awesome.

fair warning, i don't really know what im doing.

i vaguely had this plan in mind:

**leg 1 - Dec 18th to Dec 26/27th (with friend #1):**  
london -> paris + more french places -> belgium -> netherlands

**leg 2 - Dec 27/28th to Jan 5th (with friend #2):**  
netherlands (amsterdam) -> germany (berlin -> munich) -> austria (vienna) -> italy (florence -> rome -> naples)

and the idea was I'd get the eurail train pass and just use trains for the whole thing, coming into europe by landing in london and getting out by taking off out of naples. i can drop some countries in between if it's a bit too packed, but I need to stop by amsterdam in the middle to swap friends.

here are a bunch of factors that I'm trying to consider when deciding whether or not to make the trip:

1. i typically don't do summer trips because I'm always interning somewhere, but the summer after graduation (summer '25) is probably available (i think?), and there's a lot more time then. what if i just postponed this then?
2. crummy weather & shorter days - a European friend of mine was talking about how northern europe is much more enjoyable in the summer, her mom describing paris as ""hell"" when it starts snowing. the general vibes she was giving off was that by going in the winter I'm risking cold weather, haze, rain, and more. this can ruin sightseeing opportunities. does this mean I can't really experience more outdoorsy things in cities like Paris?
3. on a similar note, I'm more likely to fall ill in the cold. this is, however, largely avoidable if I stay dry, put on enough layers, and don't spend several hours outside in very low temperatures.
4. shorter hours for most attractions - I like museums, and I've heard from European friends that while lines become way shorter, they're open only until dusk
5. a common tip was to focus on southern europe and the mediterranean, but again, a lot of things I want to see are in the north.
6. from what i've gathered, winter is way less crowded, less touristy, mildly cheaper (?), and comes with its own unique experiences, especially during the holidays

i also realize the sheer insanity of the amount of stuff i want to do in such a short period of time, and I'll definitely contract a lot of this to something more reasonable, but in general I've dumped so much info because I want to vaguely communicate my interests and priorities.

any insights would be greatly appreciated, tysm",Europetravel

My friend and I will be traveling in Central Europe in the fall. We have either 10 or 11 days and we definitely want to go to Budapest and Prague. Should we consider including Vienna as it’s on the way?

We are both in our 20s and enjoy walking and enjoying the city, it’s culture, and architecture. We definitely like nightlife but more bars and enjoying the culture than big nightclubs. For those reasons, we were drawn to Prague and Budapest. 

So with this in mind, should we include Vienna? Also, how many days at each city should we spend?

I'm aware countries are well within their rights to ask for anything they like, but there's really no excuse for not clearly stating whether or not they do testing on arrival and what happens if you test positive.

Take Italy, for example. It took me over an hour of searching before I found a webpage stating that random covid tests can be carried out at the airport (or any place of entry). How many people are going there completely unaware of this? And even then, it didn't say what happens if you're positive. 7 days quarantine? 10 days? Quarantine until you test negative? This is really pertinent information that will help people decide what risk they're willing to take and it's completely absent from almost all of their websites.

Venice - 4 nights

      Boat tour to Murano, Burano, & Torcello

I’m struggling to decide if I want to spend any nights in Bologna because I’ve heard good things, but people also recommended that I spend a longer time in each city rather than spending so much time traveling by trying to sneak in extra cities, so I thought day trips might be better for that.

1671359605.0,Schengen visa rejection,"This is the first time I got a visa refusal letter and I'm pretty bummed out.

I was planning to travel with my parents and my sister this December to spend Christmas and New Year's eve together after Covid. We have Indian passports and we applied through the Greece embassy for the first time. We thought we could spend some time in a country which won't be that cold this time of the year.

The reason given bu the consulate for the refusal was  ""the information given regarding the justification for the purpose and conditions of the intended stay was not reliable""

I'm guessing the visa was rejected because I had given them [booking.com](https://booking.com) hotel confirmations? They weren't confirmed but I didn't plan on cancelling them either.

My itinerary included a 6 day visit to Athens. 3 days in Prague and 3 days in Budapest. The only thing I could have canceled was the apartment in Athens and that too for 3 days out of the 6 and switched it with 3 days in Crete/ Santorini. But that was a decision we would have taken after getting the visa and taking stock of the off-season activities in the islands and whether Santorini would be a sensible option considering my parents wouldn't have to walk too much.

More context: Over the years, my family has got 5-10 Schengen visas. We are pretty well-traveled. My sister even got a Schengen this year in June through France. We have been to UK, Canada and several European and Asian countries since the past 20 years. Our tickets were confirmed, bank statements and investments were also attached along with income tax returns.

I was looking for information about what you need to have to enter Europe, and I got really confused. It always talks about Schengen areas? I'm not sure what this means. Is it like special areas that are different from the European union? Are there different rules I need to know about? I thought all of Europe is in the European union, I didn't know there are multiple areas.

Speaking of rules, I often saw on sites they say that you need a valid passport and visa to enter Europe, and that you need the passport and visa to be valid for at least 3 months even if you will stay much less. OK I understand that, but what about Americans? We don't need a passport or a visa, so can I just use my driver's license? I only found info on passports. 

Another question is about drinking age. We are not 21 yet, but I understand that the drinking age in Europe is 18, so can we drink legally there, even if we are Americans? Or can I get in trouble for it?

My first time to Europe and I want to maximise these two months as much as possible but also not cram too much in.,"Hi all, I’m heading to Europe to the first time next year in May/June with my partner. He has spent a bit of time in Europe, both living as a child and travelling as an adult. We are from outback Australia so for me I am so excited to see something different! I want to of course make the most of my time but also not cram too much. We have a draft itinerary, what are your thoughts looking at it? 

Day 1 - 4 LONDON
Land in London, 5am. No day trips during our time here, London doesn’t appeal to me personally so I am keen to just see the sights in the city. Taking the bullet train midday on day 4 to Paris 

Day 4 - 8 PARIS 
Arrive in Paris in the arvo of day 4. Staying close to Latin Quarter. Again, I didn’t want to spend too much time in Paris as I only have a few places I would like to visit. No day trips. 
On day 8 we are taking the train to Strasbourg.

Day 8 - 10 STRASBOURG 
Really just using this as a stop over and to collect a car. It looks very cute though so we are keen to spend the afternoon/evening exploring and having dinner/drinks somewhere. 
Day 10 we will be driving to Rust, Germany (45min drive) 

DAY 10 - 12 RUST/EUROPA PARK
This was non negotiable for my partner. He has been dying to go here for years, hence the detour these ways. Arrive in Rust on day 10 morning and spend the day at Europa Park. Stay the night in the park and spend day 11 at the park also. Day 12 we will leave early morning to drive back to Strasbourg and drop back the car before catching a flight to Nice 

DAY 12 - 17 NICE
Land in Nice on day 12, relax in the city in the arvo and evening. Looking to spend a couple of days in the city but also a couple of days doing day trips to Eze etc using the train. 
Day 17 fly out to Venice 

Day 17 - 19 VENICE 
Land in Venice and spend 2 days exploring. Staying in San Marco so very central. 
Day 19 we will catch the high speed train to Florence in the morning 

Day 19 - 22 FLORENCE
Spend the three days exploring Florence. Maybe a day trip to Bologna if we want to but most likely just enjoy the city 

Day 22 - 24 SIENA
Catch the train to Siena and spend a night overlooking the town. Hiring a Vespa on day 23 to explore some of the countryside. Head back to Florence on day 24 to catch the train to Rome.

Day 24 - 30 ROME
High speed train to Rome. Maybe 1 day trip to Ostia Antica but really just want to spend the 7 days in the city. Day 7 catch the train to Sorrento 

Day 30 - 35  SORRENTO
Arrive in Sorrento day 30. Will probably be later so day 30 will be relaxing having some drinks and dinner. Dedicating one day to Pompeii/Herculaneum. Maybe a day trip to Capri. Recs welcome! Day 35 taking the train back to Naples 

Day 35 - 36 NAPLES
Train it back to Naples only as a stopover/flight to Greece. It doesn’t interest me much to spend time here so we will spend the arvo having a look around the city centre and grabbing some street food for dinner. Day 36 fly out to Athens. 

Day 36 - 40 ATHENS/ARACHOVA
Arrive in Athens midday. Again, spend the rest of the day exploring and having a nice dinner. Day 37/38 explore the city and do the essential sights like the Acropolis. Day 39 very early morning hire a car and travel to Delphi. Most likely spend the night in Arachova before heading back to Athens on day 40. Drop the car back at the airport and catch a flight to Paros. 

Day 40 - 44 PAROS 
Land in Paros day 40. Spend the time just exploring the island. Hire a quad to get around. Day 44 in the morning catch the ferry across to Naxos. 

Day 44 - 48 NAXOS 
Arrive in Naxos and spend the days just exploring the island. Again, hire a quad to get around. Day 48 catch a flight back the Athens and then another to Dubrovnik. 

Day 48 - 51 DUBROVNIK
land in Dubrovnik from Athens. Spend the few days exploring Old Town, maybe a day trip somewhere. Day 51 head for Split (still determining travel) 

Day 51 - 55 SPLIT 
Arrive in Split, spend the time exploring the city and a day trip to Hvar. Day 55 catch a bus to Zagreb. 

Day 55 - 56 Zagreb 
My partner hated Zagreb. so he didn’t want to spend time here. We are mostly using it as a stopover and so we can get a flight. The bus from Split takes 4 hours so we only have half a day and the night here. 

Day 56 - 58 BUDAPEST 
Arrive in Budapest from Zagreb and spend two nights here. Considering removing this from my itinerary and using the additional days elsewhere if you have any recs. I MAY be coming here in December for a quick winter trip with my Mum but not a guarantee. Day 58 fly out to Amsterdam 

Day 58 - 61 AMSTERDAM
Arrive in Amsterdam in the afternoon. Spend the next couple of days exploring the city. Day 61 back to London

Day 61- 62 LONDON
Arrive in London to spend the night before flying back home",Europetravel

Myself (22M), and two friends (22M and 23M) are planning a backpacking trip for a period of 6-8 weeks next summer. We're planning to leave from Toronto, Canada the second week of May.

We have a budget of $8,000 each for the trip before flights and Eurail pass. We plan to stay mostly in hostels. Our travel route right now is as follows:

Starting in Amsterdam with 5 days in the Netherlands, down through to Belgium for 2 days, 1 day in France (Eiffel Tower and Louvre), 1 day in Luxembourg, 2 days in Switzerland, 2 days in Slovenia, 5 days in Croatia, 5 days in Hungary, 2 days in Austria, 5 days in Czechia, 3 days in Germany, 3 days in Denmark, 5 days in each of Sweden, Norway and Finland. Then we fly to Dublin, spend three days there before flying back to Canada.

We know we're skipping big names like Italy, France, Greece, Spain, and Portugal, but we figure we'll see those later in life on individual trips with family or friends anyway.

We'd love any travel tips, suggestions or corrections anyone can offer us. If it helps, we're all athletic guys and we're pumped up for any hiking and outdoors activities we'll get to do. The sum of our experiences make us fairly well traveled, but we're very excited for any chance to really engage in local culture.

I am a 20-year-old male college student from the US, and in late June, my brother (23M) and I are taking on our first-ever backpacking trip to Europe. We have never traveled outside of the United States and are both very excited to experience the nightlife and fun activities these countries have to offer. We will be traveling with Osprey 40L Farpoint Travel Backpacks.

Let us know what you all think of our itinerary:

* Day 5: Morning **Flight via Wizz Air**, to Budapest
* Day 5-9: **Budapest** staying at **Hostel One**

*\*Please, if you have been to these hostels or have taken Wizz Air/EuroCity Train, reply with your experience. Also, if you have been to these cities, reply with some activities you recommend doing, preferably low-cost. Thank you :)\**

**Safety**:

Given this is our first-time backpacking, let alone in foreign countries, our main concern is safety. Based on previous Reddit posts that I have read, I know, for the most part, cities like Berlin and Budapest are rather safe. My main concern is in cities like Barcelona and Prague, where pickpocketing, scams, and petty theft crime is more common. We will be traveling with a cross-strap chest bag instead of our 40L backpacks throughout our time outside of the hostel, limiting the number of valuables we are walking on our person.

When in Barcelona, the hostel we will be staying at is off of La Rambla, approx. 5 mins away from El Raval, a neighborhood with a bad reputation for crime. I still want to be able to explore the neighborhood.

1. Are there any tips for when going through an area like El Raval?
2. Are there other nearby neighborhoods to keep an eye out for in terms of safety?

When in Prague, the hostel we will be staying at is in Prague 1 New Town, approx. 5 mins from Old Town. I've read that Prague has an increase in crime rate with pickpocketing and theft. We would like to visit the ""touristy"" areas of Prague 1, regardless of the crime rate.

1. What are some common scams to look out for while going through Old Town?
2. What are areas to avoid during the night?

*\*Any other safety tips you have, you may drop them down below, I would greatly appreciate that, thank you.\**

**Nightlife**:

We are very excited to experience the nightlife, going to different bars and clubs that are in these cities throughout the night. I know that these hostels have pub crawls which allow us to get introduced to new people as well as experience the different bars around the area, but there will be times when my brother and I would like to experience a night out without the hostel group.

1. What are some bars/clubs you recommend in either city?
2. What is the common dress code to go by when going to these places? I think for Berlin, it can be darker-colored clothing, maybe I am being stereotypical, let me know.
3. Should I be worried about getting drugged or something slipping into my drink?
4. I know the price may vary, but what is the average price for drinks/door fees?

*\*Any other nightlife tips you have, you may drop them down below, I would greatly appreciate that, thank you.\**

**Sim Card**:

We are both traveling from the US and were looking into different sim cards to use while traveling abroad, a company I saw, Orange, offers an all-inclusive plan with the following:

* Data in Europe 20GB in 4G/LTE
* Calls from Europe to worldwide \*120mn
* Texts from Europe to worldwide \*1000 texts

...we were looking for a sim card that allows for more data to be used on it.

1. Any options for a sim or esim that carries <50 GB?
2. Are there any sim or esims that are unlimited data?
3. Where to get a sim card when we land in Barcelona for immediate use of maps or a ride-share service? I know there is one in Placa Catalunya, but I would need a sim after landing.

I've heard for example some big department stores in Paris like Printemps and Galeries Lafayette (and presumably similar large department stores in other European cities) will give you the refund on the spot if you bring a non-EU passport and you'll get the full amount of the VAT refunded, whereas if you go to the brand store or smaller stores, they will give you a receipt that you have to show at the customs counter of the airport you're departing from, and then with Global Blue's fees you get only \~half the VAT refund. Is that accurate? Also, I've heard that airport duty free shops will of course not have VAT, but you're at the mercy of the selection they have and whether the store you want to buy from is in the airport / terminal you're flying out from, so that's more hit or miss

Edit: just to clarify, I am familiar with the basics of VAT refunds, in terms needing of getting the receipt in order to get a refund and needing to show it at customs, that if you don't get the receipt you won't get a refund, that you have to show the goods unopened / unused to the customs officer and that you might get hit with import taxes in your home country, etc. My question is specifically this: if you buy say a Louis Vuitton bag at the Louis Vuitton store in Paris, my understanding is they'll do the regular path of giving you a receipt which you then need to show at customs on the flight out of the EU to get back \~ half the VAT, but supposedly if you can buy the same bag from Printemps or Galeries Lafayette and you show them your passport when you buy it, they will deduct the entire VAT amount at the time of purchase, thus being both more convenient and also providing a larger refund.

1648365070.0,European travel rules and restrictions for a few countries (for indians and for others),"Covid rules and regulations for a few European countries. (For Indians but also for others)

I travelled from India to Spain, Netherlands, France, Switzerland. And here is my experience and other technicalities you need to know: 

Indian travelers it really doesn’t matter if you have covishield or covaxin what is most important is the fact that the last dose is not taken before 240 days . Since in India the 3rd dose is not officially allowed for all, this might be a problem for some . 

I entered Europe through Spain so this might differ if you enter through a different European country: all you need is finish your Spain health form it’s best if you do it in app so you can just show them the QR code. And give them any vaccination and they will let you through they don’t really check much . My friend had a Sputnik vaccination and he was not stopped though Sputnik is really not an accepted vaccine in Spain . 

I travelled by train,flight and ferry between these countries . Not once did they check for any Covid vaccination or PCR test in any of these travels. Within Europe it really doesn’t matter at least for these 4 countries . So once you are in Europe you should be good to go on most travels . Chose train if you want to be safe because there is no facility for any kind of checking process even . 

France was the only country which asked Covid certificate inside a few public places (malls, some restaurants , the moulin rouge ) . The other 3 countries once you are in you don’t have to show your certificate to anyone. 

Mask rules : 
1. Spain is the strictest of the 4 . Always wear mask inside a public place . But on the roads feel free to remove them . 
2. Netherlands and Paris  : masks only required while boarding public transports. 
3. Switzerland: keep your masks at home you don’t need it 😂.",Europetravel

1635275716.0,"Cheap multi-city Europe vacations, calculated instantly from your home city (US, Europe).","**Better way to go about planning a multi-city European vacation?**

I find it weird that multi-city trips have remained such a pain to schedule. The major travel websites force you to specify specific flight dates in a specific city order.  What if you could just.. have the best option presented to you? Well.. here it is!^(1)

**Try it out:**

[TripTumbler](https://triptumbler.com/)

**How is it done?**

Pretty 'simple' actually - *at least from the user perspective*. The user chooses:

* Cities they'd be interested seeing (up to 18 European cities).
* Number of cities they want to see (2 to 6 cities)
* Departure city (U.S. or Europe)
* Dates they're available (up to 195 days span)
* Number of days they want to be gone (up to 28 days)

From there I give them the lowest priced route (city order and dates) which conforms to those options.  I also allow them to swap in cities to see how much a particular city will add to the trip cost and swap around dates and the city order to see how it affects the price.

**But how do I know it is the lowest?**

I calculate, in real time, *every single possibility**^(2)*.

This is done by grabbing the lowest^(3) priced ticket (flight, train, bus) between each city within the dates the user is available. I then try every permutation to determine what city order and which dates are the best. Prices do shift throughout the day, so the shown price might be different than the actual price.. but it normally will give them a price that is much better than they could normally find.

&#x200B;

*^(1)* *For Europe multi-city trips*

^(2) I only use the lowest^(3) price between cities for a particular date. Also, I only have a few data sources at the moment, this will increase with time and include more opportunities for low priced tickets.

^(3) Lowest within reason.. (20hour max duration trans-atlantic, 9 hour max duration inter-Europe). I feel most people wouldn't want a 50+ hour flight.

1629490659.0,Travel Experience from LAX to NAPLES & ROME and Back,"# 

📷

Hello, this is my first time posting on reddit but I wanted to help fellow travelers during all this Covid Testing/Airline/Country confusion. My husband, child and I just got back from a 10 day trip to Italy (8/9-8/19) We are not fully vaccinated (didn't make the 2nd shot cutoff in time for travel, which is 14 days before travel for Italy). We got Rapid Antigen tests done at CVS in Los Angeles 1 day before our departure from LAX. They were covered through insurance and were free. Our child is a toddler, so none of this applied to her. We had our test result in about 20-25 mins. We chose to do this 1 day before departure because Italy and France said they needed test results from 48 hours beforehand. We were getting conflicting answers from the airline vs Italy vs France so we chose to play it safe and get it 1 day before hand. Some websites stated 48 hours before departure and some stated 48 hours before landing. As our flight would be landing next day, we played it safe. I noticed they were only checking the date and not the time (matter of fact, I don't even know if our tests were time stamped.) Antigen tests were perfectly fine, PCR was not needed. Boarding at LAX was very simple and straightforward. They asked for our negative test results during check in and that's it. We weren't asked again at LAX. As of writing this, our airline (Air France) required negative PCR or Antigen tests EVEN IF you had a vaccine card. Also, they required a hardcopy (a physical print out of the test result with MRN number, your name, Lab/Pharmacy name and date) of your test results, not just a digital format. That was reiterated to us by our specific airline.

We had a 3 hour transit through Paris (CDG), and our test results were checked there before boarding our flight.

We arrived in Naples Airport (final destination), and our tests were checked once again at security AND before entry into the country (Customs by the exits).

Once in Italy, we had very different experiences in Amalfi Coast (where we stayed for 5 days) and Rome (5 days). Nowhere in the Amalfi Coast did they ask for Green Passes, Vaccine Cards or Test results. Not at the Hotel, not at any restaurant or any other food/dining/attraction establishment. Not the ferry or bus. Nowhere, in our experience. HOWEVER, in Rome....we were required to show proof of vaccine or negative test result EVERYWHERE. All restaurants required it to dine inside (though many have outdoor seating), and all attractions and our hotel required it. Because we didn't yet have our vaccine cards, we had to take antigen tests at the pharmacy every other day for updated negative test results. The tests were 22Euros each, every time. the results took about 10-15 mins, max. The pharmacies in Italy have bright green or occasionally blue crosses signage. Not every pharmacy does covid testing, though. The ones that do will have white tents in front of the store where the testing takes place. You need to go inside the pharmacy, ask for the test, and they will take your ID (driver's license or passport). you pay first and they lead you out to the tent where the test is administered. You wait and they give you a signed and timestamped hardcopy of the result, which I highly suggest you take around with you at all times.

We had the CDC approved Binax Now antigen tests with Teledoc and took it with us, as we knew we would be needing to get tested every other day while in Italy. However, every time we attempted to log in with a teledoc, there were extremely long wait times (3-4+ hours) so we never actually got to use the tests through them. It was a great idea in theory, but didn't work out for us time wise in actuality.

Coming back to LAX was just as straightforward. We got antigen test results done a day before our flight departure from Rome, and didn't have a problem at all. We were asked for the results upon check in and then again at CDG during our a1 hour transit, and then lastly at LAX upon arrival.

All in all, as long as you have Negative Antigen test results (with or without proof of Vaccination) Traveling to Italy and back will not be a problem. Simple as that. For now.",Europetravel

I've already bought the plane tickets and soon to buy a Eurail Pass, as I plan to train between each and every destination (with the exception of flying from Berlin to Nice near the end)

I have many, many questions that I will add at the end of the post but my biggest question - is this too much for 34 days? 

My biggest concern is the stretch from Nice - Bretagne region near the end as I think that'll be quite the journey.


Dec 24th – Adelaide -> Doha

Dec 25th – Doha -> Paris @1pm

Dec 25th – 28th : Paris

Dec 28th – Jan 1st :  Paris ->  Brussels / Ghent / Bruges

Jan 1st – Jan 5th :  -> Amsterdam / Hague / Rotterdam

Jan 5th – Jan 8th : -> Cologne

Jan 8th – Jan 9th –  ->Train to Copenhagen

Jan 9th – Jan 13th – Copenhagen / Nyhavn / Rosenborg Castle / Norrebro / Kronborg castle / Mons Klint / Liselund Castle 

Jan 13th – 16th : Berlin

Jan 17th - Flight to Nice

Jan 17th – 20th : Nice

Jan 21st  - Jan 24 : Quimper

Jan 24 – 26 : Saint Malo 

Jan 27 : Paris -> Adelaide


Additional questions and things ! 
1. I am more than happy to cut down the 3 days in Paris in favor of lengthening stays at other places in my trip / accounting for train rides that take a long time (e.g Cologne to Copenhagen & Copenhagen to Berlin)

2. Should I primarily stay in Bruges / Ghent in Belgium? I've heard Brussels specifically isn't entirely as unique of a place compared to most of the other destinations and Ghent is probably my most anticipated place of this whole trip.

3. Where is the best place to spend New Year's Eve? With this current plan, I'll be in Belgium for it but if anyone has any specific recommendations that'd be very helpful ! 

4. General thoughts on Eurail Passes? 
5. Accomodation wise - I'm thinking of mixing between hostels in some places, middle of the range hotels in some places and maybe pick one destination to ball out and get a real nice hotel for a few nights in. Recommendations. My budget (not including the plane tickets I bought) is about $10,000 AUD.

1681985658.0,Routes des vins near Aix en Provence,"Hey all. I’ve just arrived in aix En Provence from nice, here for 5 days before heading to Paris. 

The main side trip I want to do here is a nice bike ride through vineyards and that kinda thing. Someone had recommended that on this sub a while back but only mentioned it was the routes des vins in Provence. 

Having a bit more trouble than I’d thought trying to google exactly where this is and how to go about getting there , renting a bike, etc. 

Hoping someone in here might have some experience or knowledge on this. 

Basically looking to do one of those sort of cliche rides through vineyards and orchards and all that jazz.

Other possible side trips I’m looking into and choosing between are Verdon Gorge, Les calanques, and Luberon.

I would love some advice on a trip to Europe next month. I know, I’m doing this terribly last minute. It’s my fiancée’s first time in Europe and I’m pretty excited for her.

Our flights arrive in London so figured this should be one of the places we visit. We also have a voucher from a planned trip during the pandemic for a stay in Florence. 

The one place she absolutely wanted to see was Paris. Given that we have to be in London and Florence, would it be stupid to try and squeeze in three countries in a two week trip?

That sounds a bit exhausting and not enough time. 

-	Plan A: 3-ish days in each city and then back home.
-	Plan B: 5 days in London, 9 days in Italy (not just Florence). This means not seeing Paris which she really wanted to do on this trip.
-	Plan C: 5 days in London, forego the voucher, and take the Eurostar to Paris. Then see other parts of France

I'm planning on traveling to Portugal with my girlfriend for about 10-12 days, in the last week of October and the first week of November, and I have a few questions regarding the itinerary and the travel, especially due to the potential weather.

We have never been to Portugal, and our main interests are: culinary, culture, urban life, nature, history and wine.

Two things to note - we are ok with renting a car (and we will probably will), and another is that my girlfriend does not eat seafood or raw fish (so we will be happy to get recommendations on special locations/cuisines to try that matches that).

Naturally we plan to visit Lisbon and Porto. From Lisbon we plan to go on a day trip to Sintra, and potentially another to Obidos as well. These plans alone should cover about half of our trip.

As wine lovers we really want to visit Douro Valley, but from what we understand the season is not optimal.

Finally, we want to get some time in the country side. Maybe visit a beautiful medieval town with nice landscapes around it and sleep in a ""semi"" luxurious hotel. A few places we thought about were the area on the border of Spain (maybe near Marvão) or up in the north near Peneda-Gerês National Park (though weather may be a problem?).  


So our questions are:

1. What do we need to know with regard to the weather?
   1. How would you do Douro Valley?
   2. What nature / countryside locations do you recommend?
   3. Any other special notes?
2. A bit related, but do you think it will be safe for us to avoid booking hotel places to trade for flexibility with weather? E.g. if we have no hotels booked (or a few), we can change locations relatively easy according to the rain. Maybe catch a good couple of days for Douro Valley or some nature destination? It's the low tourist season so that should help, and we are fine of paying 10-20% more for the flexibility. Do you think it's possible? Would you avoid it in specific locations?
3. Do you think that visiting the coastal cities in the south are worth it? We are less into resorts, and going to the beach in the time we are planning to travel is not something we plan to do. However the weather should be better there.
4. We will be happy to get recommendations for:
   1. Cuisines / restaurants / things to try (Esp. with my girlfriend's food restriction).
   2. A medieval town that matches the description above.
   3. A nature day-trip that matches our locations and the season.
   4. Anything else you think of.

I live in The Netherlands and **once the pandemic is over or at least the situation improves** I want to take a few days off from my work and travel.

Right now I'm researching the idea of going to Ukraine, more specifically **Chernobyl**.

I have a few questions:

1. Is 5 days enough for this trip? I don't know what other stuff I can do in Ukraine besides Chernobyl. I accept suggestions! I know that most tours depart from Kiev, so probably I'm going to stay there.
2. Is is worth it? I think Chernobyl history and everything that happened there very interesting, so the subject is something that I'm really interested, but I don't want to get into a tourist trap.
3. What's the best time of year to go? For this trip I don't care a lot about sunny and warm days, because Chernobyl is not exactly a ""happy place"" to go, so I think the vibe is actually more cool if the weather is grey and cloudy.
4. I know that you can only go to Chernobyl if you hire a tour guide, do you have any recommendations? I want some kind of walking tour, not these kind of tours that you go into a bus with a bunch of old people and a guy reads the Wikipedia entry about Chernobyl.
5. Is Ukraine a safe country? I know there's a conflict with Russia going on in Crimea, does this affect somehow a Chernobyl trip? I know that the distance between Crimea and Kiev is very big, so it should be safe, right?
6. How much money should I bring ? Do they accept euros or only Hryvnia? I'm a very modest traveller, I don't care about fancy hotels, expensive restaurants, shoppings, etc.
7. Is Kiev tourist friendly city?
8. Any other tips that I should consider for a trip like this? I appreciate!

For us the big cities like this are Paris, Barcelona,  New York.  The moderate sized ones are Amsterdam,  Prague,  Florence,  Seville,  Edinburgh, and Salamanca.  The little ones are Chester, Cordoba, Toledo,  Segovia, and Lucca.  The tiniest one is Setenil, Spain.  We haven't been everywhere,  so this is a growing list.

Famous places that don't make our list are, London, Oxford, Vienna, Chicago,  Madrid,  Granada,  Cesky Kromlov,  Taos, Cordoba,  York, Venice.

1695928850.0,Suggestions for New Year’s Eve. Prague or Budapest?,"Hi guys,

We will be in Italy between 22 December and 28 December (22-25 Rome, 25-28 Venice)

My first question is, this time period is effective way for celebrating Christmas? We are Turkish so not familiar with this culture and not sure about is there any specific events in Italy in the time period which we will be there. Can you guys tell us about where can we enjoy and experience this in this period of time? 

The second question as follows:
Our plan was going to Amsterdam on 28 December and stay till 2 January. However, our budget would not be enough for covering expenses in Amsterdam because this city is waaay too expensive for us. So, we will change the flights to another city in Europe for New Year’s Eve.

So, we want to go Prague or Budapest for celebrating New Year’s Eve but this is our first abroad trip and we can’t decide which one is better place to celebrate. Two Girls, low budget. 
If you know another city or country which has approx. same expenses as Prague and Budapest, let us hear from you!

I have 7 days by myself to travel somewhere in central/western Europe and I want the following out of my trip:
- 2 cities (3 nights & 4 nights)
- Warm weather (20+ degrees)
- My main aim is to be relaxed, have beautiful views, be surrounded by nature (greenery, good hikes, lake, beach, or waterfalls)
- At least 1 city with amazing nature and greenery, can be a bit secluded even
- Potentially 1 city with great beaches and maybe even beach clubs for full relaxation
- Potentially 1 city to have really good food
- Potentially 1 city could be more urban 
- Don’t want to go to Greece or Croatia as I’ll travel there in the future 

What I previously enjoyed:
- Positano/Praiano because of the insanely beautiful views, great hike, Positano had the beaches and beach clubs, Praiano had the calmness
- Paris because we didn’t do any attractions, just people watched at cafes all day
- Lake Como because of the immaculate views, small town feeling, beautiful lake
- Mallorca, in particular Deia and Soller cos of the warmth, beach, beautiful views

My current thinking:
- Portugal: the Algarve and Madeira (or even Lisbon or The Azores)
- Italy: Cinque Terra, Sardinia or Dolomites
- Spain: San Sebastián 
- Switzerland: unsure where…

What other combination of cities would suit my wants? What have you visited that sounds like the above?",Europetravel

My gf and I are exploring options for a 24-day roadtrip in France next June. We're looking to rent a van/camper van and explore the southern half of the country, driving a loop to get back to the original destination. I'm half-French and have been to the country on a yearly basis since I was 3-4 years old so I'm fairly well traveled there, but I've mostly used trains to travel around so I need help with the nice roads, small villages, natural wonders, etc. 

We're looking to land in either Bordeaux, Lyon or Marseille - there's direct flights between Montreal and all three cities so that isn't an issue. The one sure thing is that we don't want to go to Paris. I lived there for a year recently and the gf visited for two weeks so we're good in regards to Northern France.

We want a nice mix of cities, picturesque villages and parks, and we don't mind a bit of a drive - ideally mostly on Départementale roads to take it easy and see the small villages and stop whenever we feel like it. We like understated spots, picturesque roads, small lakes, mountain-side/top camp options, nice small town squares and markets, etc.

The one obligatory stop is Morzine, in Haute-Savoie. My family's from there and I want to show my gf where I spent my summers as a kid. Otherwise, we're pretty open to all options, and would like to combine the Alps, Provence and another region where we could drive around small historic villages and take it easy for a few days. Also don't mind starting out in Bordeaux and knocking out a few longer drives in order to reach the eastern part of the trip if we find something worth it along the way.

Here's an itinerary that I made up quickly with a few small villages and towns around parks/regions that we'd like to visit. Looking for feedback and suggestions. Ideally, we'd like to keep the trip under 1500 km total, but can be convinced to go longer lol. Thanks in advance to all who can help out!

1) Northern half of Europe: this would involve London and Paris for sure, then however much we can fit in of Amsterdam, Brussels, Germany, or anything else we think is interesting.

2) London + Italy: We both kind of feel like Italy deserves its own trip, but since we're flying in and out of London, this itinerary would involve a couple of days in London, then however much we can fit in of Rome, Venice, Florence, and the Amalfi coast.

I'm been a SEA traveller, but when it comes to Europe, I'll be honest in the fact I have very little idea of the ""right"" way to travel. I've done some googling and thought it best to double-check I'm not doing anything silly.

**For context:**

* It will most likely be October (any commentary on this month is helpful)
* It's myself and my soon-to-be-wife for our honeymoon
* I'm still trying to find a nice scenic train ride, hopefully in Switzerland (we might need to expand that part of the trip).
* We're not completely locked into Florence or Lyon and have moreso added this as friends and family recommended it. I'm yet to see if we'll switch these for more time in other places, so if you have any alternatives or suggestions for things to do in these two places go ahead.
* We will be back in Europe eventually, so I don't mind that I'm not ""fully exploring"" these cities or countries, and will use the 2-3 day stops to get a better understanding for future trips.
* We're interested in medieval history sites, ""wow"" scenic spots and pop culture areas.
* We're not interested in beach locations, as we come from Australia. But lakes and such are nice.

* Copenhagen (8-day cruise)
* London (30 days)
* Paris (25 days)
* Zurich (30 days)
* Nice (25 days)

We are open to unusual or nontraditional accommodations. In fact, that would be preferred because we want to integrate more closely into the environment instead of treating the experience like tourism. It's important that we have access to a kitchen because we want to cook most meals.

- good public transport (doesn't have to be on time, but offer some connections to remote scenic sides, with the ability to travel early in the morning and come back at night) 

- fresh local produce food, not a fan of fancy and expensive restaurants, huuuge fan of local veggie/fruit produce, sweets and fishes! 

- street art, vintage style, handcrafted goods, medieval buildings, mediterranean architecture, laid back atmosphere without every second building covered with kitsch flashy souvenir shop windows, more like small family owned business would be an advantage 

- open air farmer markets, cultural events (Barcelona festa style) would be a big plus.. How do things look like now in covid times? Are there any events with limitations or are they canceled all together? 

- being able to easily travel by bike or rollerblades (bike lanes, smooth asphalt)

1626411320.0,1 Month in Europe - Itinerary doable for 2 young-ish newly-weds?,"My husband and I are finally taking our honeymoon (got married during the pandemic) and are spending a month in Europe. I feel pressured to see as much as I can, and I don't mean in a bad way. I'm excited to see everything I can and drink up the culture and food along the way. I also feel like we may not make it back here for a while, so I'd like to do a lot, but not too much so that we hate each other at the end.

1618238404.0,Six Cities in Two Weeks by Night Train,"My partner and I along with my sister and my partner's friend are in the very, very early stages of planning a trip to Europe next spring (really hopeful everything is open by then).

At the link below and in the photo is the itinerary I built based on Eurail's ""Europe by Night Train"" itinerary. I know that six cities in just a little over two weeks is very ambitious, but of the five legs of travel from city to city, four will be on night trains, so the travel itself won't eat as much into our time in each city as it would otherwise.

We know that we won't be able to see all there is to see in each city and we are okay with that. This trip is more to get a good feel of what cities we would like to come back to and spend more time in because none of us have spent much time travelling within Europe.

Barcelona does seem like a bit of an outlier (especially since it is the one leg of the trip that isn't by night train), but in college I spent five weeks in Barcelona so it is definitely where I want to end the trip.

We had wanted to do London and Rome as well, but we aren't sure we can get more than two weeks off work, plus we think that the UK and Italy/Greece historical cities each deserve their own dedicated trips.

Does this sound feasible as I have laid it out? If we plan ahead as well as possible to mitigate jet lag, do we have a chance of not being basically zombies by day 14? Any other thoughts and advice are welcome!

* I'm planning on going at least to Germany, Poland and Hungary (Budapest), with other places of interest being Prague, Italy and France.

* Hamburg is the only place I'm pretty much set on, since I want to visit a friend there.

* I'm not on a shoestring budget but don't want to over spend.

* I don't drive, so limited to public transport (I do plan on taking short flights if more convenient)

As mentioned I'm open to any and all recommendations, but I do have some particular questions.

* How cold can I expect it to be this time in March? Am I risking finding too much snow (an incovenient amount) in these countries at the time?

There are very few places in Europe that I don't want to visit, so I'm having a really difficult time narrowing down where to start. I'll be going for only around 14 days and would like to spend 2-3 days in each city. I've been skimming for where the cheapest flights are (25 year old almost law student on a budget lol) and so far it's showing the cheapest cities for a round trip for me are Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Warsaw, Paris, Milan, and Zurich (all showing about $450-500 for a round trip which I thought was a great deal). So I’m hoping one of those might be a good starting point I could circle around back to. Dublin was the cheapest at under $400 and I thought about just doing Dublin and the UK, but not sure if that's my best option or not.

If this helps at all, my biggest focuses are historical sites, museums, and good nightlife. 

I figure that after I get there I'll do public transport to travel between cities and circle back to the airport. I also know the weather will play a part in this which is why I'm asking specifically about late Feb/early March.

1703245349.0,"My flight got cancelled in advance due to bad expected weather, but the weather turned out fine… am I owed compensation?","
I’ll probably get roasted for this in the comments, but I believe it is a valid question. My flight was cancelled approximately 40 hours before it was due to depart because of a severe weather forecast. Other airlines flying the same route did not pull the trigger on cancelling their flights. About 12 hours after the flight got cancelled, the weather forecast got significantly downgraded and those that weren’t cancelled ended up going ahead as scheduled. Therefore I can’t help but feel the airline cancelled the flight prematurely and travel plans were, as a result, unnecessarily disrupted. Perhaps the airline wanted to cancel the flight anyway and they saw this as a good opportunity as it does seem quite early to cancel a flight due to weather. The flight would’ve been in the air right now, and the weather (particularly the wind) is not anywhere near what is considered problematic. I understand it is different a few kilometres in the air, but there are other flights currently travelling that route with no issues.

Love art and architecture and churches and opera. I'm a freelance photographer (among other things), so I love walking around taking pictures. Not a big foodie (great food is great but I don't pick destinations based on food... I just don't care that much and I try to eat very affordably while traveling, so I usually just get takeout sandwiches or other simple foods). Not a nightlife person. Will be relying on public transit and traveling alone. Two-star hotel budget. I can speak a little (very basic) Italian.

It's totally OK if it's quiet/low-key: I'll need to do some work in the evenings anyway. I just don't want it to be closed up.

Some cities I've really loved, if it tips your vote one way or the other: Siena, Lucca, Venice (the quiet, outlying parts... I went in the off-season), Trieste, Vienna, Granada, Paris, Edinburgh, Budapest, Freiburg, Berlin, Chania, Naxos, Strasbourg

I am seeking some tips and recommendations for my solo Europe trip this winter, and I am having some trouble deciding between where I should go. I am a 20s male from the US, and and just for reference, I’ve been to the UK, Italy, Switzerland, and France already so I want to go somewhere new. 

Here are some of my favorite things to do while traveling in cities and some other criteria:

- exploring charming and interesting neighborhoods with nice architecture 
- eating great and interesting food across a variety of prices
- bakeries/desserts/pastry shops/coffee shops 
- interesting nature within/around cities e.g. gardens, parks, rivers, mountains, etc (ik it may be limited in the winter)
- cool experiences to appreciate/connect with the culture and place (whatever that may be)
- would prefer to take trains between cities rather than flights 
- slightly prefer calmer peaceful cities as I live in NYC and I’m used to hustle and bustle

Not very interested in:
- clubbing or partying
- drinking culture
- beaches or beach cities per se (spend a lot of time in California)

Also, which cities would be cheaper? Accommodation budget would be probably 100-200 euros a night, and I wouldn’t want to stay somewhere too bare bones

Any advice or tips would best appreciated! Thanks!",Europetravel

Will have 8 days in early February for Norway & Sweden. Want to fly into or out of Stockholm to see it and check off Sweden from the list. But also thinking *Tromsø* sounds great to really have the authentic arctic experience.

What else could we fit in that’s a good winter destination? Bergen? Oslo worth it since we’ll be doing Stockholm? Anywhere else in Sweden? Is Rovaniemi, FI worth it?

1701027330.0,Best Weekend Trips From London,"Hi!

I’m a student from the US studying in London next semester and planning a few weekend trips for when I’m there. So far I’m thinking Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin, and Edinburgh, but looking for other recommendations, inside and outside of England. 

I’ve been to Paris, Edinburgh, London, and Rome before and enjoyed them all. I like vintage shopping, indie movies and poetry, walking around cute neighborhoods or charming towns (like Giverny!) and trying cafes, being in nature. Large museums, clubbing, fine dining aren’t priorities. Cheap transportation/ accommodations would be nice but not a dealbreaker. 

Can provide more details too if needed! Thank you!",Europetravel
1700933704.0,Airalo vs. Holafly for E-Sim?,"Hi! I'll be traveling to Czech Republic, Germany, France, and Switzerland this year for roughly 20 days and want to get an e-sim for my travels, mostly for data usage. Does anyone have experience using Airalo vs. Holafly? I'm looking for an e-sim that is convenient and will cover all the countries I'm going to so I don't have to keep setting it up as I travel from country to country. While it may be cheaper to get a physical sim or to set up the e-sim at the airport, I've had bad experiences previously with that and would prefer to set everything up before leaving so it's all ready to go when I land.

I've heard Airalo offers a limited amount of data based on the package (with an option to top off if data is all used) and that Holafly offers unlimited data with calls, but I'm not sure if I would even need a European number because I don't really plan on texting or calling especially when WhatsApp or Signal exists.

1700541845.0,First Time in Europe Itinerary Advice,"Hello! 

I'm from Canada and planning on spending roughly 8 weeks in Europe next summer. My trip will be from mid-May to mid-July. 

For the first two weeks of my trip I will be travelling with my parents and then after they will be going home and I'll be travelling solo. 

It will be my first time in Europe and first time travelling solo! I know it's a big trip but I'm looking forward to it and do quite well by myself. Will be backpacking and am looking into maybe staying in some more social hostels at the beginning of my solo trip and meet some people, and then possibly quieter hostels or airbnbs to relax a bit near the end. I have outlined my current trip plan below.

&#x200B;

**With parents:**

&#x200B;

London - 4 nights 

Paris - 4 nights

Belgium (Antwerp or Brussels maybe?) - 1 night

Amsterdam - 2 nights

Copenhagen - 2 nights

Norway (visiting some family)- 3 nights

&#x200B;

**Solo:**

&#x200B;

Budapest - 3 nights

Vienna - 3 nights

Prague - 3 nights

Munich (maybe? I'll take suggestions) - 4 nights

Innsbruck - 1 night

Dolomites - 2 nights

Venice - 3 nights

Florence - 4 nights

Cinque Terre - 3 nights

Milan? (possibly on way to Switzerland?) - 1 night

Switzerland (Zermatt? Lauterbrunnen?) - 4 nights 

Nice - 4 nights

Aix-en-Provence? - 1 night 

Extra (possibly Dublin to visit a relative, and probably end in UK because there is generally cheaper flights back to Canada from London) - 6 nights

&#x200B;

**Travel:**

&#x200B;

\- In terms of travel mode it will be mostly rail and/or buses. Should I book ahead for these? 

\- For Amsterdam-Copenhagen-Norway, Norway-Budapest, and Switzerland-Nice it will probably be flights. Maybe flights to and from Prague depending on cost.

\- Also, I was thinking of renting a car between Munich-Innsbruck-Dolomites-Venice.

&#x200B;

**Specific inquiries:**

&#x200B;

\- I know that there's always more time to be spent in each place, but how is the time allocation? Should I spend more/less time in any specific place?

\- Planning. So obviously booking places in advance is a good idea due to high demand during the summer and to save on some prices, but should things like train/bus travel and specific tours and such be planned well in advance? What's some good practice for planning vs. leaving flexibility while backpacking.

\- If spending at least 1 day in Belgium, which city should it be?

\- Is fitting in Copenhagen worth it? I really want to see the city, but it does shorten time that could be had longer in Amsterdam.

\- Should I stick with Munich/Innsbruck/Dolomites or do this lag somewhere else? I think it would be a good transition into my Italy stint, plus I think it would be cool to see at least a bit of Germany. I chose Munich for proximity to other places and the Bavarian culture, maybe for a day trip to Könogssee and Salzburg, but I'm not set on it. An alternative to this section of the trip could be maybe Croatia and then to Venice from there? What do you recommend? 

\- Dolomites! Seems like a really cool place to spend time hiking. I know it's pretty expensive but there seems to be some better priced airbnbs outside of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Is it worth doing a couple of days here? I could do some hiking in Switzerland later on but I do love hiking so wouldn't mind having more than one dedicated hiking place on my trip.

\- Florence. Really excited for this part of the trip, but should I give up some time for Bologna before getting here or try to fit in some days from elsewhere? I hear the food is great in Bologna.

\- Milan. Of course I would love to see the city for longer but won't be able to based on time, so would it make sense to spend a day/night here on the way to Switzerland from Cinque Terre? Seems like the trains go through here anyway.

\- Switzerland. I would like to spend time here, preferably in the mountains. Would 2 nights each in Zermatt and Lauterbrunnen be a good idea or should I just pick one, or somewhere else entirely. Also, with the plan to head to Nice after, does it make sense to take rail to Bern and fly out of there?

\- South of France. Would love to get some ideas about this. Nice would be awesome, with a day trip to Monaco. Calanques National Park catches my eye, so should I spend one night or more in Marseilles? Seems like I'll be here during lavender season so I think it would be neat to take a day trip to a field, would it be worth it and should I go to Aix for this? For roughly 5 nights, what would you recommend?

&#x200B;

So that's the current iteration of my trip so far. I'm hoping I'll get a decent mix of interesting architecture, nice landscapes/places to hike, art and culture, and places with good food. Socializing and partying a bit would be cool but not necessary; I want to stay safe and also get some good rest most nights. I know there is a lot going on in this post but I accept any advice/recommendations you may have! Please give me good places to stay, things to do, food to try in any of the places mentioned or other places you recommend instead. I really appreciate any responses!",Europetravel
1699478866.0,How can I tell what train is mine?,"Good evening everyone. Before I ask my incredibly stupid question I must tell that I am an American, never have I had any experience with trains until I moved to Poland 2 months ago. 

I’ve done a little traveling (Warsaw to krakow, Krakow to Ostrava and back etc) just small trips. But I always stress how to know what train is mine. I mean I look at the board and the times and the train number (EC 114 for example) match up with my ticket, but then the train comes and no where in the train does it say EC 114 unless it has one of those digital boards but not all of them do.

So, my train was late on the way back from Ostrava, so I couldn’t just line up the time, and when a train came that said it was going to Krakow on my platform, I almost got on but it had the digital board that said IC 111 instead of EC114 

The next train was mine, but it didn’t have any marking or boards that said EC114 or anything, I just guessed and happened to be right.

But I’m really stressing, if the train is late, how can I tell what train is mine just from the info I’m given in a ticket/ board at train station??

In the past (Iceland, Costa Rica) I've used a rentable portable wifi but I'm reading that that isn't ideal in central europe, nor can I find a place that rents them.  it seems that in Germany the best option is to get a local SIM card. I've never gone the SIM card route in a foreign country before. Wondering if anyone has any experience doing this and can point me in the right direction. I have a few questions

1) My understanding is you can get SIM cards thru some of the grocery stores like Lidl. Is there a way to preorder this and pick it up on arrival? Is there a way to preorder this and have it shipped to me in the US? 

2) Will this work in each country I go to or do I need a different sim card for each country?

1685958252.0,Sharing my first solo Europe travel experience and how I got pickpocketed. What would you have done?,"Hi all, I would just like to share this first solo travel experience where I got pickpocketed in Switzerland. 

I was in England / Scotland for 10 days and all was fine, I was very careful with my belongings. But just on 3rd June, my 2nd day in Switzerland, I was taking a golden pass scenic train from Montreux to Interlaken on first class.

When I was boarding, there was an Indian male in front of me and an Indian female behind me. The Indian male went up the train and then came back down and bumped into me and I had my wallet in my pocket. At that moment I was distracted and when I went up the train and loaded my luggage, I realised my wallet was missing. I panicked as I never been pickpocketed before and my cards my ID and cash are in there. I went around searching the cabin (especially the front where I boarded, at least 5 times and I couldn’t find anything. I asked around all passengers in the cabin and nothing as well.

Then just when I was about to get the police at the station, I walked out and the Indian woman behind me then came running out of the cabin waving my wallet at me.

I was thankful at first but when I checked my wallet, all my cash were gone. About 800 CHF And 250+ £ in total. I then got suspicious and asked the lady that returned my wallet where did she find it? She said front of the cabin, where I searched more than 5 times and didn’t see my wallet there.

That was when I realised, she must have been the one that pickpocketed me and I then told the train inspector about what happened as the train just departed and he tried to call for police along the stops to come onboard and search this woman as we didn’t had the rights. However, since it’s a scenic train on a Saturday, the police were not available on any stops along the route. I then tried to take photos of her and confronted her and she was really nervous and just said she just found my wallet and knows nothing. There was nothing else I could do and I had to wait till I reach INTERLAKEN before I made a police report.

The police then told me it’s summer season and it’s very likely this woman worked with the man who bumped into me to cause a distraction and to pickpocket me. The police said there’s a lot of such criminals around the stations who are under syndicates / gangs where they pretend to be tourists, dresses and acts like a tourist. 

This is a very expensive lesson and it’s also a lesson for my first solo travel, not to put so much cash in the wallet and always be vigilant especially when solo traveling. Help yourself before helping others as you will never know if the intentions of others are genuine. 

Even though I lost this 800 francs and 250+ pounds, I am still thankful I guess I got the opportunity to travel and thankful that I had emergency cash not in the same wallet. It is very unlikely for me to get back that money as the police told me.

If any of you knows this lady, that travelled on the 10.50am first class golden pass rail on 3rd June Saturday, around in Switzerland, do show her this post and tell her to dm me :) 
Tell her to enjoy her lowly life as a thief and take that money as a donation to a poor soul like her. Such lowlife pickpockets will have karma hit them hard I’m sure. They will never be able to have their heads high in life. Forever lowly peasants. 

I’ve lots of photos and videos of this lady and her face which I shared with the police but I won’t be posting here as the mods said it isn’t allowed. I’ll continue to spread this message around many platforms especially those switz related and share her photos wherever possible 
The police will review the cctv at the station and send me images of the man if they manage to find anything, which I will share as well. 

Just be aware if you spot this Indian looking woman with glasses, about 1.6m tall asking you to help with baggage or standing really close behind you on train and platforms in Switzerland as she is likely taking trains around working with others to pickpocket tourists / solo travellers like myself. 

To everyone else solo travelling or tourists touring Europe this summer, do stay vigilant and keep your valuable safe! Stay safe everyone x",Europetravel

Option one:
Greece, up to Croatia, then Hungary, Vienna, Prague, Berlin and then head down to Venice and do more of Italy before coming from back up to do Swiss alps then Belgium 

Or option two:
Greece then across to positano, making way up to Italy then crossing Venice over to Croatia (or Milan to Swiss?) Budapest and so on.

We'll likely be flying in and out of Milan so were thinking of heading to Lake Como straight upon arrival, and doing 1 day in Milan before flying back. 

Some questions:
1) Is 4 days in Lake Como too much, should we do 3 days and put another day somewhere else? 
2) Is it worth it going to Genoa? It's mostly because we also want to do a half day / day trip to Portofino, but I don't know if Portofino is worth it either. If we don't do the 2 days there, any thoughts on where you'd put it? 
3) Should we do more days in Florence? I've heard there are good day trips from there (any recs?) Is Pisa worth it? I'm not too keen on spending a half day just to see the tower but if there's more to the city, I'm willing to go.
4) Is 1 day in Milan doable or should we add another day? Worried it might be rushed too since we're flying next day. 
5) Any changes to this itinerary or cities you'd add that are close by? I'd like to remain in the vicinity of Milan / Florence on this route so don't want to stray much farther. I've already been to other places in Italy like Venice, Rome, Amalfi Coast, etc. so don't want to go there. 

The itinerary:

4) Florence - 2 days

5) Milan - 1 day",Europetravel

1678057860.0,Where to stay in different regions of France,"Hi all, I'll be doing a Europe trip from Apr-Jul this year. The first leg is France, and I'd love some insight as far as where to stay in different regions. 

My dates in France are Apr 12 thru April 30, and below is my general itinerary. I probably won't stray too much from this as I'd rather explore certain regions than take 100 trains to go all over the place. But I'm open to suggestions. The one item left off my list is Chamonix, which I'd like to see, but it's a bit out of the way, and later on the trip I will be doing several days in the Swiss Alps, so I think that will suffice.

Would love some suggestions of what to do/see in the below regions and cities, and some details on how to do my desired items (eg bike rides through vineyards)

* **4/12-4/14 Nice - 3 days** \- Not sure what to do here. Might visit beach 1 day depending on weather. Any sites of interest? General things to do in Nice?
* **4/15-4/18 Provence - 4 days** \- Where should I stay? I'm leaning towards Aix, as it's central.
   * 1 day cycling through vineyards (recommendations please. Someone suggested Route des Vins--any specifc regions within that? Can they all be done in 1 or 2 days?) 
   * 1 day side trip to Gorge du Verdon (how do I get there if I don't have a car?)
   * 2 days within Provence to explore/eat/drink/etc - recommendations on sites/museums/etc?
* **4/19-4/20 Marseille - 2 days** \- Not sure what to do here, but hopefully visit some nice Riviera locales. This is late April though and may not yet be beach weather. Is Marseille worth it for just 2 days, or should I instead extend my stay in Provence, or go somewhere else?
* **4/21-4/23 -** **Tours and Loire Valley 3 days -**
   * Again, here I mostly want to rent a bicycle and ride through the countryside, stop at some small places to eat, be outdoors in the natural beauty, that sort of thing. Recommendations? Is 3 days too long in Loire? Maybe I can do just 1-2 days and the rest in Tours?
* **4/24-4/30 - Paris - 8 days**
   * I know the obvious stuff I want to do here - Louvre, dining, Notre Dame, etc
   * 1 day side trip to Giverny
   * Any other good side trips from Paris worth doing? Someone suggest Versailles. Is that worth it?

&#x200B;

In general, I'd like to do city stuff during the week--explore, musuems, parks, eat, etc, and then more nature stuff on the weekends. I no longer drink, so I'm more of a day person than a night one. Not too concerned with night light. I am more interested in outdoors, nature, and fun stuff in the city. 

Any obvious regions you think I am missing? Should I replace once city with something else? Etc?

\- Astronomical Clock

\- Sex Machine Museum (interesting visit lol)

I've never seen anything like it. It's 2 floors, like a maze, steam punk themed (you don't have to dress like it's steam punk. You can wear regular clothes, no dress code). You can also play foosball and pool and chill if you don't feel like dancing either. I had so much fun!

1670732745.0,Central Europe trip planning advice,"👋 all!! I’ve never been to Europe & currently planning on Central European countries as my first time. (Female 28)
I would love to get some pointers from folks who are more familiar with the area to help me with planning.

I love history, architecture, museums, artsy stuff as well as hiking, kayaking & being in nature. It’d be great to hit a balance of both on this trip, if not, focusing on one is totally fine as well. :)☀️

Here’s a rough route I came up so far: ✈️ land in Munich & 

Munich -> Prague -> Brno -> Bratislava -> Budapest -> Vienna -> Salzburg -> back to Munich all by 🚊 🚌 

Questions I have at the moment🥹
1. Does the route make sense for someone that’s only gonna rely on public transportation?
2. City/Town you’d recommend adding in/ taken out from the route?
3. How many days roughly would you stay for each city?
4. Anything else related you think might help💗

Thanks very much🙏✨!!!",Europetravel

We just so lucky the weather was sunny for those 10days.(Wear tshirt/short) most of the time. 

The reason why we split between paris 2 days on beginning and 2 days on the ends  we don’t want connect fly to Rome and worry flight delay (due to weather). Also east coast fly to Paris was so much cheaper than Rome. 

We averaged walked over 220k steps or 10miles each day. Transportation we use bus/  train / Uber if it too far to walk. We navigate with google map (very helpful). For Paris you can save money by using the train . Of course we use Uber if it too complicated to switch train. In that case make more sense to Uber . 

For hotel we book near 17th ave in Paris,  Termini for Rome, for via Forte marghera  for Venice . 



Place we visited:

Paris (Eiffel tower along the surrounding attraction area . Also palace of Versailles

Rome (colosseum, Vatican City , Trastevere, along the area) 

Venice ( beside Venice we visited Burano , Murano. 

Things I regretted : I should have do 3 days in Rome instead 4days. Secondly Paris just need 3 days was enough. We should have add Florence/Italy .

I way prefer AirBnB cus I like a place with a homey feel, and I like to cook/have a kitchen, but looks like I gotta do a hotel there, cus the BnBs even on the outskirts are crazy expensive.

Literally nicer than my studio in NY.

Dec 25 - 28 : 3 days in Montmartre, Paris.

Dec 28 - 29 : 1 day in Brussels.

Dec 29 - 31 : 2 days in Antwerp (Day trip to Ghent)

Dec 31 - Jan 5th : 5 days in Amsterdam (day trips to The Hague & Rotterdam

Jan 22 - Jan 26: Undecided.

Jan 26 - 27: 1 day in Paris (Flight out of CDG @\~0800 on the 27th)

Ideas I've had / heard:

\- skipping Odense in favor of another day in Copenhagen, or another day in Hamburg.

\- In the blank period near the end, 2 nights in Quimper to possibly see a friend or a few nights back in Paris (still able to see friend)

\- Dispersing those 4 days at the end to add another day or two in the bigger cities.

Also, it's my first time both travelling overseas and going solo, so any tips would be appreciated (especially from any fellow aussies reading this!)

I am aware that these are quite conservative countries and just want to avoid any trouble as much as possible. We’ve been to Croatia before without issue so I’m not really worried about running into trouble here.

The obvious stuff is we will avoid PDA and just pose as friends - did this in Slovakia with no trouble but we did get declined a hotel room.

It was a normal Wednesday afternoon when I received registered post from Cité du Vatican. I can't say the Pope and I have been the tightest of pen pals but I'm happy to hear from him none the less.

Imagine my dismay when it's not a missive from old Franky but a traffic fine for €207.

I was on my honeymoon in Tuscany a year ago. Upon closer reading it says they have 360 days to send out the fine or it will be outside the statute of limitations. They managed to get it out with 3 days to spare. What luck.

Given this happened a year ago I have no memory of what occurred, but I looked up the intersection on Google maps and my best guess is that I made a right turn on red which is legal in my country of Canada but is not legal in Italy as I have now learned.

They also want me to provide copies of my license and all personal information for the deduction and reporting of points, and if I don't that risks further fines.

1612945365.0,US Citizen looking to travel Europe for a few months [QUESTION],"Hi everyone,

I've been looking forward towards making a trip across the Atlantic to see what the European side of the world has to offer, for the last 6 or so years of my life, and I finally plan on doing so from May / June until early August. However, I'm having trouble finding consistent resources on what documents I need to get in order to make this a reality.

The main thing that I want to note is that my plan is for my itinerary to be very flexible - I don't really want to do a lot of real ""planning"" in the form of ""I'm going to spend 3 days in France, leave at 3 PM on Friday, go to Italy, do X and Y and Z"" etc, I really just want to be relatively open minded with it and just meet locals and figure out some fun things to do while I'm in the area. So, this kind of seems like a little bit of a conundrum since the Schengen visa that I looked at is for strictly 90 days -- is it possible to apply for a longer visa? I know I won't be staying longer than 120 days, and I MOST LIKELY won't even be in the Schengen area more than 90 days; however, I do want to have an extension ready to go so I don't have to waste time or get stuck without the proper documents, if I do want to stay longer.

So basically:

1. what documents do I need to allow for more flexible travel in the area this summer, if that is possible?
2. do I, as a US citizen still need to apply for a travel visa in Europe? some resources I found said that I have basically an automatic 90 days in the Schengen area, while others said that in 2021, US citizens would have to begin applying for the visa for tourism.
3. is there anything else I need to prep for the trip (document wise, or anything that would take me more than a few weeks to get through the process of preparing for)? not like clothes but again things like the visa or documents which could take weeks to process?",Europetravel

One of my co-workers really hyped me up on the Amalfi Coast and we started looking into staying in Praiano (at a hotel that has a free water taxi). The thought being that it would solve two of the chief complaints we'd heard about the Amalfi coast being 1) it's too crowded and 2) it's impossible to get anywhere by car/bus. I realize that a free water taxi wouldn't solve all of our problems but would at least let us get to and from Positano and Amalfi easily if we wanted to check those places out.

But then I got some other feedback from some friends that said the Amalfi coast is way overrated and now I'm sort of at a loss. Should we stay somewhere else on the coast, stay in Praiano, or just go somewhere different entirely (likely Florence / Venice)?

We'll be in Italy the first week in October, FWIW. We don't have kids but probably will soon, so the sell we've gotten on going to the Amalfi coast is that it's not a place you'd want to go with kids so now is the time. Would really appreciate some feedback!",Europetravel

We love hiking, any great areas in and around Nice? We love to explore, as long as we're safe. We also both are distance runners. I'm not sure if there's any areas for that, scenic running routes? That would be very cool to do!

We plan on spending at least a week in Southern France and a few days in and around Paris. We'll fly home from Paris. We haven't thought beyond 14 days yet, for travel and the actual time in France.

Somewhat in the area, I'd love to take him to Le Mans, just to see it, not for any live racing. We'll be visiting Monaco also. :)

Looking for places to stay long term, Nice will be our home base for over a week. Our 40th anniversary is mid-July, but, the timing isn't important for this trip, just going is though.

I am a professional photographer so I'd rather take the photos of the places, I don't have to do the tour also.

**Wish list of things to see and do.**

***This is the highest thing on the list for me. Dream photo opportunity.*** 

***Provence for the lavender, so sometime in June/July.*** 

**Cannes**

**Monte Carlo**

**Monaco**

**Le Mans**

**Toulon, which is where he would port in the US NAVY.**

**Nice for hiking, maybe creating a fragrance for me, the beach and just relaxing.**

**Paris for chocolate, pastries, food, shopping, art.**

**Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris**

**Seine River**

**Arc de Triomphe**

**Louvre Museum**

**Hôtel de Ville Carousel**

**Eiffel Tower** 

Any hints, helpful comments, recommendations or places to stay away from are welcomed. We love doing things off the beaten track and only known to residents, as long as we're safe while doing them. Any tips for places to eat that isn't touristy. I love to bake and I'm getting into chocolate also, so anything in Paris that's in that realm I'd love to experience.

I'm the tourist, he's been to all of these places before, except Le Mans and except anything in Paris. He wanted to bring me to the city of Light himself and to view it for the first time with me.

1597574510.0,Travel restrictions for USA and EU citizens during Covid,"I feel very strongly about what happened while traveling in Europe during these restricted times. Basically, I traveled to the EU with my dual citizenship. Flying from LAX there were no strict requirements which surprised me. I stayed in Poland first. There I decided to travel to Finland. I bought a ticket for this last tuesday. On Monday Finland put up more restrictions. I transited from a country with some restrictions. When in Finland, they had my entire flight go through internal border control where they stopped me, questioned me, and contacted everyone I knew in Finland. They sent me for further questioning. Then internal border control decided to unofficially 'deport' me even though I bought my own ticket (costed me another $400) out of Finland that same day while being questioned. Short story, they escort you all the way to the boarding plane and make sure you board. Very unpleasant! In addition, they make sure you return to your country of origin. So if you are a USA citizen and get caught on the border then they'll deport you to the US! Make sure you check all the travel restrictions before flying. And the travel hack here is to transit from a country with no restrictions. Safe travels!",Europetravel

My side of the family is from Germany, and so a couple weeks will be taken off the total to allow for visits to various areas of Germany. I speak fluent German, and have spent most of my summers in Germany, so I’d really like to branch out and visit some other countries around. We have a budget that maxes out at about $25,000 including flights from Canada. 

We will be most likely flying into Frankfurt, and will need to spend a little time in Munich. From there we are looking at spending time in Italy and Switzerland. We definitely want to take some sort of train travel like the Bernina Express or something similar. 
My husband is also looking into doing a cruise of some kind that leaves from Italy or around there, and visits a few different cities or countries. 
Basically we want to visit Switzerland and Italy for sure, and have to visit parts of Germany. Everything and anything else is up in the air. I’ve done Europe trips in the past but not with two young kids in tow, not sure what places have good things for families.

1705384585.0,"Rude people in Kraków, Poland","People in Krakow being rude to Mexicans

 Cześć!

Some years ago (2016) I lived 2 months in Poland, since I was collaborating on some project. I had a GREAT experience, and everyone was nice and friendly to me. I do not remember a single time when someone was rude to me. 

However, after wanting for years, I finally visited Poland again last November (a super short visit and only in Kraków). I felt that a lot of people were being rude and perhaps even hostile to me, my girlfriend, and a couple of friends. Before I give some examples, I would like to say that I am very polite and respectful (At least try to). Also, I learnt some suuuuper basic Polish. So, when I talk to any person or buy anything in Poland I always greet in Polish, and then I apologize for not speaking Polish, and finally I ask in Polish if they speak a language I know. 

Now, for instance, I went to the legendary Pijalnia Wódki i Piwa. The girls attending the bar looked like they hated everyone, but when my GF asked for some water, one girl like ignored her. Then, she stared at my GF like if she had insulted her, and finally served some water. (Note that my GF is the sweetest and politest woman to exist). Then, in Kraków Główny, we were going to take a night train. So we wanted to buy some drinks and coffee in a store. When we entered and were looking at the coffee machine the lady attending the store rushed to the machine and said: ""It's not working anymore"". Also in Kraków Główny I wanted to buy tickets to Oświęcim. I went to the ticket office and ""Dzień dobry! Poproszę pięć bilet"" (I know there is a mistake in that sentence). The lady said something in Polish, so I went ""Przepraszam, nie mówię po polsku"". The lady started yelling at me. Of course I did not understand, but I felt like she was saying: ""If you don't speak Polish then get TF out of Poland"". Later, in a café we wanted to grab some drinks. My GF asked which tea options they had, and the lady said: ""How many?"". So my GF repeated like: ""Oh, I would like to know which teas you have"". The lady aggressively asked again ""How many?"". (I mean, it's kind of obvious that we wanted to know which teas were there before buying, right? If there was not a tea she likes, then we would have no tea.) After that, another lady intervened, and she was actually nice. Later, in Oświęcim we wanted to buy something before taking the train back to Kraków. We entered a café in the train station. Before saying anything, a lady immediately told us: ""We will take long to prepare"". So we felt like she actually meant: ""I don't want to attend you.""

I guess it's meaningless, but just in case: I'm a dark skin Mexican (so like brown-ish, not black). My GF is also Mexican, but she looks like Japanese (petite woman, small eyes, white skin).

So, I want to ask for your impressions. Did Polish people become rude? Was it that we had bad luck and managed to find all the rude people in town? Did they hate us because we don't look ""white"" enough? 

I felt so sad about this, since back in 2016 all the people I met and interacted with were awesome, and I visited several cities, not only the touristic ones. 
---------------------

TL;DR: In 2016 I stayed 2 months in Poland, and I had an awesome experience with the people. I visited Kraków last November and a lot of people were rude/very rude to me, my girlfriend and a couple of friends. So, I want to ask for your impressions. Did Polish people become rude?

I’ll give you a little info about what I like if you think it will help:

- I LOVE to immerse myself in a culture through the local food and drink. Any type of food I like and for drinks I prefer trying new beers. German beer has been my favorite so far. 
- I prefer historical artifacts and informational/guided tours over looking at paintings at museums. 
- I LOVE to walk and explore a city’s public transportation system. Not a huge off-road hiker but anything with a great scenery I’ll consider
- I love to explore a city’s nightlife. I like both but prefer bars to clubs

I  am a very shy female and planning on visiting Schengen zone countries next summer  (2024). I start off by saying I'm shy because it makes travel very hard  for me especially asking for help and getting around. I originally wanted to visit Switzerland but thought it might be too overwhelming for me. I'm not sure what would be the most efficient country to start off my trip. I have some questions about staying,  traveling around, food and the likes. I would love to hear feedback and  tips or advice on how I can feel the most comfortable in whichever country is recommended while also enjoy my time there.

Some  more information about me if that helps in recommending places I should  visit or stay. I love being in nature, hiking, and generally  quaint/quiet atmosphere. I get very anxious if I'm put into a big  bustling city. I'm also a Person of Color so feel a little uncomfortable  being in public with lots of people/loud tourists. Additionally, since I  am shy, it's very challenging for me to eat at restaurants. I would  like to stay someplace where I can buy food from the supermarket and  cook myself.

**Places to see**:  what places should I visit if I love nature, hiking, animals, football  games, charming old owns, quiet countryside, bookstores?

**Food**: I am a vegetarian. What supermarkets should I shop at?

**Places to stay**:  I would prefer something not too far from supermarkets so I can buy  ingredients and cook myself but I also want it to be a bit quiet area  and around nature if possible. Something 15 mins away walk from a train  station or grocery store would be do-able.

**Getting around**: What is the best way to get around town or around in general? Should I take trains or taxi or rent a car?

**Other**:  I would like to shop for clothes and warm hats while I'm there. Nothing  too expensive but I would like to buy a nice jacket because I get cold  easily and pants too. Maybe some wool socks and beanie. What is the  weather generally like during June or August. What would be the better  time to visit? Anything else that will be helpful for me to know? Are  there other countries in the Schengen you would recommend I can visit?

1686610724.0,Announcement - Reddit Blackout,"Hi,

As you may be aware, Reddit has recently announced planned changes to how its API is accessed by third-party apps. If you aren't, a new sub has been set up to explain what these changes will mean to us as users. In short though, charging them for access will put many of these apps out of operation as most are labours of love made by people who simply want to improve how the site works. At best, it will remove quality of life apps from use and at worst it will destroy certain third-party accessibility features that Reddit does not include natively, such as readers for the visually impaired.

As a response many subs across the site (across interests ranging from r/gaming to r/Paleontology and everything in between), have decided on a ""strike"", and as a mod team we have decided to join them. What that means for the sub is that until June 14th, no new posts or comments will be allowed. The answers already provided will still be available to search, but an auto-mod will delete any comments left between those times.

Of course this is a slight inconvenience, but it's not long of not being able to post for what we think is a good cause. Even ignoring quality of life improvements provided by third parties, the removal of accessibility features seems indefensible. We hope, as all taking part in this action do, that this will encourage a rethink from Reddit.

1662935697.0,7 things I wish I knew before traveling thru Europe,"My wife, 9 month old and her grandma spent 2+ driving thru Europe. To be exact, 10 countries and 29 cities. Most blogs and YouTube videos don't cover a lot of information that could be really useful for travelers, specially those with kids.  Below are 10 things I wish I knew before :

1. Public transportation is great. You can rely on it to get around the city and in between cities as well. In some cases in between countries. Tip: do as much research as possible but don't rely on the transportation staff for help 
2. Poor customer service - expect service to take time. If you want something, like water, desert or even your bill, expect to go and get the wait staff your self. In  hotels, most staff aren't too friendly or will go the extra mile. All of the above is more pronounced in countries like Germany, but less in Italy 
3. Europe is not infant friendly - most places don't have ramps for strollers. The concept of changing tables practically does not exist. Some doors, even elevators, are too narrow for the strollers to fit in 
4. Air conditioning is rare - most restaurants don't have a/c. Almost every hotel has a/c but they keep it just barely room temperature , that is if it's working at all. In airbnbs, the a/c either do not work or there are not enough units for the entire place. Tip: bring a mini fan. Avoid going in the summer if possible 
5. Drivers are hyper aggressive - on our first day I was driving on the left lane at 140kmh. A car pulled up right behind, to the point of causing an accident, and started to flash their lights, beep their horn and waving their arm. My family and I were petrified. I thought something was wrong and they were alerting us,  but as it turns out they just wanted to pass us. This same thing happened everywhere thru Europe, but we were prepared. 
6. You have to drive to throw out the garbage. If you're staying on an airbnb, you may have to go a mile or few blocks to throw out the garbage 
7. Overall quality of airbnbs is much lower -  appliances at airbnbs don't work, including the air conditioning and fridges. There was usually a power surge if you had too many appliances in at the same time. We'd find ants, roaches and spiders and the host would act like its normal

1698514472.0,Greece for 3 months - residents visa seems like overkill!,"
I would be grateful if anyone can provide any help with Greek visas, more specifically the Type D Residents Permit.


My partner and I, both from the UK, are looking to do some traveling throughout Europe next year. Our plan is to spend 2.5 months in France, followed by 3.5 months in Greece. Thanks to brexit we are now limited to 90 days, as per the Schengen visa to travel through Europe, however our 90 days will run out not long after we arrive in Greece. We need to do these trips consecutively, so leaving the Schengen area for a while before returning isn’t an option. It seems that there is no option to extend a tourist visa, and that we would need to apply for a type D residence permit, which allows a stay for a year. This seems like overkill, as we really don’t want to stay for a year, however it seems like we don't fall into any of the other visa categories.  We receive £30,000 per year each in dividends, so don’t meet the digital nomad criteria.


My question for anyone who might have experience in this area, are they likely to reject us as we we be staying effectively for only 3.5 months? Should we try and demonstrate that we intend to stay for longer? Or could it actually work in our favour, if we say we intend to leave, as I understand the concern seems to be that you could become a liability to them.What are they actually looking for when they issue these visas? Do they care why you are here and for how long?

Furthermore, some websites seem to indicate that there is a requirement to stay for 183 days, although I can’t find this confirmed anywhere on the official website. Finding the whole thing very confusing so any advice would be much appreciated!",Europetravel

1697200733.0,Bird strike on my plane,"Hello fellow Europeans, 

I have a question concerning a flight to Europe that I booked but was canceled a few days ago. I hope someone who experienced this or has legal knowledge about this can help me out. 

I recently went on vacation to El Salvador. I had booked a flight to get back to Paris, my hometown, on the 9th of October (from San Salvador to Madrid, then from Madrid to Paris). However, my flight was canceled because the plane hit a bird when landing in San Salvador. I had to reschedule my flight to the next day. The airline is Iberia (Spanish national airline). 

Now, I'm interested in getting a compensation from Iberia because of the cancelation of my flight and the 24h delay I subsequently experienced. 

I read on the internet that bird strikes are considered an ""extraordinary circumstance"" by the EU legislation as shown in a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on May 4th, 2017 that made precedent. According to this, the airline is not expected to compensate me. 

However, in my case, the bird strike did not happen on my flight. The plane was flying from Guatemala to San Salvador and was hit by a bird upon arrival in San Salvador, which canceled the rest of the trip to Madrid. When researching this specific case (bird strike happening on flight from A to B whereas my reservation is from B to C) I see mixed answers, some saying that I should be compensated and others saying I should not. I don't see a mention of these specific circumstances in the precedent set by the CJEU that I previously mentionned. 

So, what should I expect? If someone is well versed on this specific topic or experienced this before, I would be glad to know if I can get my 600€ compensation or not and how to defend my case to the airline. 

I also saw that the airline was supposed to prove that they took all the measures they reasonably could to avoid the incident and have to prove it to the regulators. How can I know if they proved this?

Nor do we want to ship it to her just before travel. We would prefer to take it to her when we meet at the airport port in Dulles.

1704386710.0,Trying to Plan a Girl's Trip in September,"Hi!

A group of my friends and I are trying to build a European itinerary for a 2-week trip around the August 30 to September 14 time frame.

The only issue is that we want to cover a lot of ground, but aren't sure if we'll be able to enjoy it all in one go.

Here's the running list so far:

1. Start in Scotland\* (Probably hit Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Highlands. \*Also note, we'll all be flying in from different places around the U.S..)
2. Then go to England (Probably just go to London)
3. From there, go to France (For Paris)
4. Finally, end up in Italy (Rome, Venice, Florence,...)

Would it make more sense to *only* do 2 or 3 countries to get the most from each country/city? I fear we're going to be wasting a lot of time traveling and moving from each place.

To give more background, we're a group of 4 in our late 20s/early 30s with no kids and a pretty conservative budget trying to get the most bang for our buck (this is also going to be a birthday trip so we can splash some cash if needed!).

This will be a first-time European trip for 2 of the members so obviously, we're looking to see some of the top attractions (Big Ben, Eiffel Tower, Colosseum, etc.) but we're also open to off-the-beaten-path excursions as well.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

**EDIT:  I'm second guessing myself thinking that $2,500 USD - $3,000 USD is NOT a big enough of a budget for this kind of trip. (I didn't include airfare in this budget) Should I consider saving $5,000?** ",Europetravel

Obligatory I am on mobile and formatting may suck. 

I am (finally) graduating from law school this coming May, and my husband and I are heading to Europe shortly after the bar exam. We used our credit card points to get flights and will fly into and out of Dublin. We’ll land in Dublin the morning of August 4th and fly home early afternoon on August 13th. What we haven’t decided on is what to do in between!

Neither of us have been to Europe before. We want to have a trip that mixes relaxation and exploration, since I’m going to be exhausted after the bar is done. We’ve talked about Majorca and/or Bordeaux, and are open to flying or train travel. I think we’re trying to avoid the classic big cities just because we don’t want to feel guilty for not going to see all the things, if that makes sense. Dublin was cheapest for flights, but we don’t feel attached to staying there very long if it means more time somewhere more suited to our desires.

My wife and I came from the US and have been staying in Rome for a couple of months. We’re hopping over to the UK in January to stay there for a few months as well. 

We have our cat with us; coming to Italy with her was fairly easy, we just had to go through all the vet paperwork and get her EU health certificate within 10 days of travel and endorsed by the USDA. 

Going to the UK seems to be similar (albeit actually getting into the country with her seems a bit more difficult) - we need a Great Britain health certificate from a vet. We’ve found a vet here in Italy that can do the cert. 

My question is: will that cert be valid for us to enter the UK with her?  As the cert would be from Italy, but we’re US citizens (and obviously can’t get it certified by the USDA, if we even need to?), will we run into any issues?

1698852960.0,Warmest/sunniest place in Europe in December? (Without a car - ideally not an island),"I'm trying to brainstorm potential destinations that aren't islands. I know people will automatically say the Canary Islands or Sicily,  but I'm not sure these will be options for us. We don't drive, can't rent a car so would be dependent on public transport, which I don't think is widely available in Sicily. (Went to the Canary Islands as a child so don't want to repeat the same destination.) We walk a lot and are very active, but I'm not sure if that's enough in terms of getting around there.

Islands like Mallorca/Malta, places like the Algarve or Crete don't really appeal to me as I feel like there's not too much to do outside of beaches/walking. (Lisbon/Madrid are out as we've already been to these cities).

Last year we went to Seville (plus Granada/Cadiz/Cordoba) and it was incredible, so amazing to have beautiful warm weather at Christmas, seeing *actual sun*. (I'm in the UK so Vitamin D deprivation is very common all year round.) I felt so much healthier and happier, so I think a sunny destination is an absolute must.

The best thing about Seville was also getting to see the beautiful architecture and historical sites, so I'd ideally want that as an option, as opposed to only beaches/nature walks. We considered Milan, but as that's Northern Italy I assume it would be quite cold/snowy. We're considering Rome as potential option, or Naples (visited only Tuscany 4 years ago).  I've heard that it snowed in Rome in 2018 but apart from that, the weather is usually warm? Puglia seems quite touristy. I was also considering Barcelona as we've never been, but not sure if it will be too crowded in December.

We've been talking about hotels and at some point, despite not being sure about our itinerary or if those hotels were convenient, she made some reservations in Berlin through Booking.com. I say some because she booked two hotels in Berlin for the same dates. 

I don't believe she was lucid or mentally clear enough to make those reservations and pay for them. She has no memory of making them. When she found the charges to her credit card account, she thought it was a scam and filed a fraud report with her bank. And if that doesn't make it clear enough that she wasn't sound of mind to book these hotels she booked two different hotels for the same city and same dates.

I contacted Booking and they said I had to deal with the hotel to cancel the reservation, to which they sent a request to the hotel. I suppose in the request the situation was explained and Scandic said they could only offer us a name change. 
I made such emphasis on my belief that she wasn't lucid when making the reservations because I assume there are laws or something that protect older people when they make such mistakes right? Specially in countries like Germany and The Netherlands.

If you can offer your similar experience with this or advice I would be very grateful. Sorry if I come off as mean or impolite, but this situation has me a stressed out. And obligatory sorry for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.

1692890179.0,Help us optimize our europe trip by car :),"Hello everyone,

My wife and i have been planning a trip around europe by car, for next summer. We would love your suggestions on what to do different and what we have missed, that we shouldn't. We plan for our trip to take 14 days but we're taking 3 weeks of vacation, so we have some prep days before and relax days after. This also means we have wiggle room for extra stuff, if it sounds interesting.

We try to save money by sleeping in tents and only doing hotels a couple of nights. This also allows us to spend more money on food and activities.

Our interests are architecture, wine, great food, beautiful nature, hiking, human disasters, murderers, terror (like Hitler, Pompeii, Sep. 11th) and old charming buildings. We love places where we, in some way, can use our bodies (walking, illusions, physical activity, animals, eating lol)

Also, we're not the most patient people, so unfortunately we don't use a lot of time in places and rarely go much into detail. For this reason, we believe that we can make this trip, with small modifications. This is also the reason there are almost no museums.

Questions:

1. Are there any general rules for cars, in any of the countries, that may not be known for foreigners? *Example: In Germany, you need to buy a sticker for your front windshield, to compensate for the environment (or something like that)*
2. For any of the stops, do you have recommendations? (buy the expensive ticket/guided tour because it's worth it, buy the official ticket at X, park for free at X, ask for this wine, go shopping at this place)
3. Is there anything big or small that you would recommend us to **eat**? If so, in what country?
4. Is there a restaurant you would recommend us to **visit**? If so, where?
5. If you could add a maximum of 2 stops to our trip, what would they be and why?
6. If you could delete a maximum of 2 stops from our trip, what would they be and why?
7. We started planning for this trip 2 years ago. At that time we put £700 in the budget for gas only. (\~5.200 km at \~16 km/l = 325 l. (avg. price) £2,15/l = 325 \* 2,15 = £698,75) is this still realistic? We're going to drive a Hyundai i10.
8. For **all** meals, we put an avg. price of £26,83 in total for both of us. 3 meals a day = 26,83 \* 3 = £80,49. The whole trip would be 80,49 \* 14 = £1.126,86. Is this realistic?

We will gladly provide any additional information needed. Thank you for your time and wisdom.

My wife and I would like to get away for the easter weekend, leaving Düsseldorf or maybe Amsterdam probably late Thursday early Friday, maybe until Monday.

We are in our 40s, so not exactly looking to party. Honestly, after a day of activity, a good meal, hot shower and comfortable bed is awesome. We aren't opposed to something a little off the beaten path. I've looked as far north as Sweden, the Alps, the Bordeaux coast. Ideally, given the 4 days, i don't want to spend a day between flying and bus transfers getting to the final destination. I like the idea of the train, but they seem to be 12 hours to get anywhere like the french Alps 

I have heard the snow conditions aren't great in the Alps. As we aren't tied to Downhill skiing, is there still lots to do? Is there bad weather discounts on?

I’ve narrowed my choices down to Vienna, Paris, and Amsterdam, but can’t decide on which one. (Note I’ve been to Paris twice but both times a long time ago and not in the winter). Here are my criteria for what I am looking for:

- Beautiful architecture, walks, cityscapes
- Charming and interesting neighborhoods to explore
- Good food/coffee/desserts (seems like Amsterdam doesnt have the most interesting food based on my prefunctory research?)
- The ability to enjoy indoor activities that arent only museums (I love museums but don’t want to be confined to them solely if the weather is too bad)
- Not *too* dead, dark, or dreary in the winter to the point that it feels depressing and bleak
- Unique cultural experiences 

- *And finally, a little embarrassing but would really enjoy a feel similar to the Wes Anderson movie The Grand Budapest Hotel (unfortunately cannot go to Budapest itself bc of a lack of award flights that i’ll be using to book my trip)*

Honestly, I have no idea what the ""Reddit-style"" posting rules are here, so I'll just write as best I can, and I apologize in advance. 😅

So, here's the story: in the next month, I'm planning a trip to Germany. It's not exactly a typical tourist trip, in the sense that I don't plan to visit all the famous sights and take photos by the Berlin Wall.

Since I was a kid, I've always felt like I was born in the wrong place... and now, I think like my true home may be in Germany.

That's the main reason why I signed up on Couchsurfing and am trying to find hosts there. Unfortunately, it's not a social network where people are active all the time, and most of the offers to host me come from older men, which makes me a bit uncomfortable.

Please, take a look at my itinerary, and if you have the possibility to invite me to stay with you for a couple of days, I would be incredibly grateful 💖💖💖💖

I'll bring some treats, we can chat about life and cats, and of course, your dreams, because they are definitely important.

In return, I'll bombard you with questions about life in Germany, the local mentality, and how things work there in general. It's like a ""test drive"" of the country, which is why I don't want to stay in hotels or big cities. If you're in a remote village along my route, that's perfect—I'm up for it! 😅

A few important points:

* I can sleep on the floor, hay, or pretty much anywhere.
* If you live with friends or in a community, that's even cooler!
* I vape.
* Also, I work remotely, so I often get absorbed in my laptop or phone (but not in the evenings).

Please take a look and text me anywhere if you don't mean to share your roof with a Ukrainian girl for 2-3 days 🐧💚

My itinerary as it planned for now is Dresden > Erfurt > Kassel > Gottingen > Munster > Bremen > Berne, but everything can be changes :)

1691889629.0,Cultural peculiarities from a North American who just finished an Alps road trip!,"Greetings! I grew up in Canada, and have also spent time living in Australia and the United States. I recently finished a trip where I went to Europe for the first time to road trip the Alps including France, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Overall it was such a great experience and an absolutely gorgeous continent. I wanted to point out some cultural oddities that I thought were peculiar/interesting differences in contrast to how things are done in North America.

**Driving:**

\- I noticed that many of the major motorways in Europe require a toll fee. At first I was disgusted at having to pay every time I went on the motorway because I am simply not used to doing that as virtually all motorways in North America are free. But I later realized this actually makes a lot of sense because it is much more common in Europe to not own a car, and therefore those paying for the roads are those actually using the roads more. This also gets tourists who use the roads a lot while vacationing to help pay for the roads, as well as helps prevent the major motorways from getting too congested. In the US for example, all the interstate highways are free and paid for through federal taxes but tourists end up paying nothing to use the roads since they don't pay American income taxes. Europe actually seems to have a logical system here.

\- Roundabouts: Love them. I cringe going back to the US and having to deal with endless traffic lights. I don't know whose idea it was over here to barely use roundabouts but I can say after using them extensively in Europe on this trip that they are objectively smoother and better than traffic lights for moderate-to-heavy traffic intersections.

\- Severe lack of parking and always pay-to-park even in smaller towns and suburbs. I guess it comes with the territory of having a lot higher population density and encourages people to use more environmentally friendly means of transport, so I get it, but I still found this very frustrating compared to the US where unless you are downtown in a city there is always ample free parking.

\- Speed limits are usually very generous in Europe, often 120-130km/hr on motorways which is nice. In Canada for example there are no speed limits higher than 100km/hr even on a straight highways through a rural area it is incredibly restrictive to the point of absurdity. Also police patrol for speeders much more in Canada and the US, I did not see cops hiding around corners waiting to catch speeders in Europe like I commonly do in North America.

\- Road signs seem to be not so user friendly and I don't think it's a language barrier! For example, in Germany numerous times while on the motorway I am looking for a specific exit only to see a sign that simply says ""Ausfahrt"" but does not provide any further label of *which* exit it is or where it goes?! Other times there is a sign that lists 6-8 different streets/locations that the exit goes to in very small font that is impossible to read until you get close, making it impossible to read and make a decision before passing the sign and the exit. Very frustrating, and definitely missed numerous exits because of these quirks.

**Bathrooms:**

\- I couldn't help but notice an incredible lack of public bathrooms, and those that do exist often charge money for use!! I found this kind of astonishing considering it is a basic human function that cannot be stopped and it is somewhat cruel to basically say you have to piss yourself if you don't have change on you to pay the bathroom toll. Numerous times I struggled to find a bathroom to stop at while driving on a road trip. In the US it is super easy to find bathrooms because every single gas station has a convenience store attached with public bathrooms. I noticed in Europe many gas stations/pumps do not have a convenience store or bathrooms. I then tried to stop at grocery stores and was told there are no public bathrooms there either. Where exactly are people supposed to go?? Usually restaurants want you to make a purchase to use the bathroom. I have never in my life seen a bathroom that charges a fee for use in North America, so this was very interesting to me!

**Restaurants:**

\- LOVE that the advertised prices already include all taxes and is the final price you pay. Much more consumer friendly. In the US the price on the menu does not include taxes, and also you are expected to tip, which will drive the final price up often 30-40% above what the menu price states once you factor these in. Tipping culture in the US is incredibly toxic and exploitative and I appreciated that there isn't this kind of pressure in Europe. The table service I received did not seem to suffer at all despite there being no tips, great dining experiences overall.

\- Europeans love to charge for water!! This isn't a thing in North America, you can get free water at any restaurant. I was confused the first time I asked for tap water and was told they don't serve tap water only ""still, or sparkling?"". I didn't even know what ""still water"" is. Never heard that term before. In North American restaurants ""still water"" is just called water and ""sparkling water"" isn't really a thing. It does exist here but it's very niche and typically most people do not drink sparkling water and many restaurants do not offer it on the menu.

\- Alcohol is dirt cheap. I was shocked that in Italy wine was the same price as water, and in Germany beer was the same price as water. Getting a glass of wine at a restaurant for 3 euros was shocking. In the US you will struggle to find a restaurant that will serve you a glass of wine for less than $7-8 USD which is vritually double the price, and then you must tip on top of that.

**Hotels:**

\- The first hotel I checked into in Europe I called the front desk angrily, exclaiming that none of the lights were working in the room. The desk clerk sighed (another stupid American!) and explained that you must put the hotel room key in the slot by the door to activate the power. This blew my mind, as there are no hotels in North America where I have seen this. It makes sense though to try and limit waste of electricity as guests tend to not care about wasting electricity if they aren't paying the electric bill, so kind of a smart idea.

\- Maybe it was just the fact I was in the mountains where it isn't supposed to get too hot, but basically every hotel I stayed at lacked air conditioning, or if it had air conditioning the thermostat was locked so that the temperature could not be adjusted. This often made sleeps very uncomfortable. At first I assumed it was to save power, but mind-bogglingly most hotels had the heat cranked up even on cold nights and would not let you turn the temperature down wasting heat/electricity unnecessarily. It was 10c outside and 23c inside my room, and I could not adjust the temperature. In most hotels I ended up sleeping with the windows and balcony door wide opened to cool off the room because all hotels had the heat cranked up so much it was stifling. I have never seen a hotel in North America where the guest could not adjust the climate control for the room, so this was again a very new and somewhat uncomfortable surprise!

**Architecture:**

\- European towns are beautiful compared to their American counterparts. Such timeless and quaint architecture in most small towns I came across, even the less touristy ones. In America most small towns are incredibly drab and anemic, lacking character and essentially they look like shit compared to the beautiful styling and architecture in European towns. The streets are also kept much cleaner in Europe than a typical US city/town of comparable size which was very nice.

Anyways, this is getting very long now. Love the Alps, loved the european food, and loved the friendly conversation struck up with so many hikers I came across on my travels. You guys have a beautiful homeland and I definitely wish to visit again in the future!! That is all.",Europetravel

I’ve been waiting to visit my beloved 98 year-old great aunt for 3 years and after reading the Dutch govt’s entry requirements last month, I met all the criteria and finally felt safe booking a refundable flight. But based on the most recent changes to Holland’s covid travel rules (as of March 23, 2022), I think I'm not able to enter the country...

Why? My country (Canada) is not on Holland's “safe list”, so I can't enter unless I'm fully vaccinated or have a recovery certificate. I am fully vaccinated but “*The official validity period of a proof of vaccination is 270 days after the last dose*”, and the day I land is 273 days after my 2nd dose.

* Option A) If I first visit France and Spain (which accept covid recovery certificates regardless of the country of origin) and spend some time there, could I then fly into Holland without any issue because I’m entering Holland from another EU/Schengen Area country? How many days would I need to spend in the EU before I could enter Holland?
* Option B) What if I enter Holland by train after spending some time in France?

I have a question regarding travel. I am flying to France from the USA next week and have a COVID test scheduled for the day before my flight. 

I am fully vaccinated (with a booster) and had COVID three weeks ago. I heard that some people can test positive for weeks after their infection even though they are no longer infectious.

That being said, if I test positive, would a doctor's letter clearing me for travel be sufficient to fly to France?

1669051924.0,"Missing exit stamp from Spain, how do I get it added?","looking for advice about how to get a missing exit stamp added to my passport. Basically, earlier this month I went to Barcelona and received a stamp on entry to the country, but when I left the country I didn’t get a stamp to say I left Spain. I was wondering how to get this stamp retrospectively added to my passport. This is quite a big issue because based on my passport it will look like I have overstayed at any point in the future after 90 days have passed since I entered Spain and so I may well be denied entry for any travelling in the future (I have read online that’s this happens so I think it would be stupid to just assume that it will never matter).

&#x200B;

My problem is how do I get a stamp added back to my passport. I have tried phoning the consulate and explaining the situation and they said there is nothing that they could do and that I would have to return an EU border with proof of my flight and ask to get it added back on. Surely there must be a more convenient way to get this situation corrected than having to pay hundreds for a trip to the EU within the next few weeks I don’t want to make to correct a mistake somebody else made. I was also wondering if an EU border from another country could add the exit stamp for Spain on. I should also add that at Barcelona airport the border force booth for non eu citizens was not open and when I walked towards it I was directed to go the booths that EU passengers used. Also, I didn’t not go to an E-gate on entry and when I phoned the Spanish consulate they said there would not be an electronic record.

TLDR; returned to the UK from Spain but didn’t receive and exit stamp (so in the future I will appear as an overstayer) and want to know how to fix the situation without resorting to travelling to the EU again before the 90 day visa free period expires.

EDIT: This happened at Barcelona el prat airport so if you are flying from there then watch out

EDIT 2: please dont bother commenting if you are just going to tell me this is a non issue because I am looking for a solution and not to be convinced I can simply sweep this under the carpet.

UPDATE/FINAL EDIT: To anyone in the future who reads this thread I can tell you that in the the end I went to Amsterdam a few days afterwards to get a stamp. Unfortunately, the border force there could not add a back dated stamp for when I left the EU/Spain a few days prior but they did give me an exit stamp when I left. As a result, the stamps in my passport show I did leave the EU well before the 90 days were up. When I next travel after the 90 day period is up I shall make sure to bring proof of travel from Spain to the UK for that time my passport was not stamped. Also, don’t bother reading the comments because they are stacked full of idiots who just assume that this is a non issue ( here’s proof that it can be an issue: [https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/read-this/british-woman-denied-entry-to-spain-due-to-post-brexit-passport-stamp-rule-3441553](https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/read-this/british-woman-denied-entry-to-spain-due-to-post-brexit-passport-stamp-rule-3441553) ) and they don’t actually answer my original question of getting the situation resolved.",Europetravel

After that one is used I cant get another one of the same type, so next time I visit the schengen region, I need to get a residency - employed person visa which is different.

Id need to arrive in the schengen region, then apply for a seperate EU Working holiday visa, (idek if I can do that), so I can leave Schengen area in time and work in EU for a while maybe.. then what happens when that visa runs out? Back to Schengen region with a new type of visa for another $600 I wont have? They might not even accept the application either!

Do I just keep bouncing back and forth between EU and Schengen because they keep kicking me out?

1703711741.0,10-12 Days in the Netherlands and Flanders; Interested in History,"Dumb American here!

I am a student of history interested particularly in the Renaissance era in the Low Countries and the Tachtigjarige Oorlog. 

I am planning a 10-12 day trip to visit historic sites in the region related to these subjects. I am interested in maximizing my exposure to historical sites and art and less in relaxing to lazily spend a few days in every city.

BUT! I don't want to be frantically travelling each and every day - either by rented car or by train.

I have a long list of places to see, but here are a few locations without consulting my notes.

Netherlands:

- Amsterdam (planning on spending as little time as possible in the tourist chaos of Amsterdam apart from seeing the Riksmuseum and possible the Amsterdam Museum)

- Delft for the Prinsenhof and possibly the Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles

- Possibly Drenthe / Groningen for Vesting Bourtange and the Hunebedden (my partner is being very patient with me for this trip, and she would love to see these)

Belgium:

- Antwerp for its Grote Markt the Plantin printing museum

- Ghent or Brugge for the historic old towns (only time for one)

- The Namur Citadel and the Ardenne region

**My questions:**

1. Is there a strong reason to choose either Amsterdam or Brussels as an airport? Rumor is Schiphol is pretty crazy. Prices seem to be about the same.

2. Are there other historical sites or collections from the 1400s-1600s should be on my list? I'm less interested in the 'Golden Age' of Rembrandt and Vemeer, but am open to suggestions!

3. Are the Ardennes and/or the north of the Netherlands in Drenthe and Grogingen going to be too far to visit with a 10-12 day itinerary?

4. For such a wide-ranging trip, does it make sense to rent a car, rather than travel by train?

5. If we travel by train, can we ""hub and spoke"" out of two or three cities for the duration of the trip (which relates back to the question about Namur and Groningen)?

* Date: 22 December 2023
* Depart Salzburg: 15:34
* Arrive Linz/Donau: 18:00

1. Does this mean I can take any train AFTER the original train?
2. Can I take a train BEFORE my original train from Linz/Donau to Vienna if there is one? For example, can I take this train? It is earlier than the train that is now broken but we arrive in Linz/Donau at 18:00 so is possible to take it.

1700333250.0,first trip to Europe (advice please),"hello!

I (24F) am looking for travel advice for my first time going to Europe. I will be flying out of Colorado, USA and I'm looking to start my adventure in Paris and to end my time in Madrid (flying back to the US from here) for a 10 day trip in the last two weeks of March 2024. 

**Paris/France and Madrid/Spain are non-negotiable travel stops for me as I have always wanted to go to Paris and I'll be visiting a friend in Madrid. A few questions:

From a quick google search, it's recommended to stay 3-4 days in Paris and 2-3 days in Madrid. Anyone with experience agree/disagree with these suggestions?

Does anyone have suggestions on what places to visit in between my time in Paris and Madrid? 

I'm currently thinking of spending 2-3 days in Cinque Terre. But! I am unsure if this is a good idea given the potential for wet conditions hindering hiking, potentially closed restaurants/shops in the off season, inability to relax by the beaches (also weather related) etc. Thoughts?

Other places I'd be interested in seeing at some point (not necessarily on this trip) are - London, Amsterdam, Switzerland, and Barcelona. I mostly worry about trying to fit in too much in too little time. Quality > Quantity. Do you think 3 places (2 of them being Paris and Madrid) is reasonable for a 10 day trip?

Would I need a tourist visa for any of these places? If so, how do I obtain one?

If I choose to visit some of the previously mentioned places on this trip, how many days do you recommend that I stay at each?

What's the best way to get from each destination? Is flying or taking a train a better economic option than another? If I take trains, is it worth getting a Eurail global pass? *I recognize if I opt for a train, there is the potential to sacrifice multiple days for some of these estimated 8-10 hour train rides from one location to another depending on the destination...

I'm open to any other suggestions that people give that might be helpful.

Recommendations on getting good deals on flights for international travel (I'm clueless, never left the country before).
 
Recommendations of places to stay (e.g., hostel or hotel, or other?) in the respective cities (and/or how to find trustworthy places to stay). 

Recommendations of sight-seeing/touristy things and restaurants to go to in the respective cities.

And anything else I might need to consider or need to know as a first time traveler to Europe

1696869314.0,2 week travel around Europe in Campervan for family of 5. Crazy or doable?," Hello all. Wife and I are looking at trying a 2 week campervan trip around Europe next summer. 2 adults, 3 teens (one is pretty small). We have camped our whole lives from tent to a big pull behind so are comfortable camping in general. We've never tried in a small campervan. To keep costs down and make it easier to drive in general in the cities we are looking at the smaller VW vans from Roadsurfer that supposedly sleep 5.

This is the itinerary we had planned. We are used to long road trips having travelled coast to coast in the US twice. That was in a minivan and we stopped at inexpensive hotels each night and used an air mattress for our youngest. We usually drive, stop a few hours and then sleep. Repeat until trip ends.

Amsterdam / Colonge, Germany / Frankfurt, Germany / Neuschwanstein, Germany / Innsbrook, Austria / Trento, Italy / Milan, Italy / Geneva, Switzerland / Bourges, France / Paris, France / Amsterdam

In France we are planning on 2 days at Disneyland and will likely do a hotel vs. camp.

According to Google Maps each day should only be 2-4 hours of driving which is fine with us. We picked Amsterdam for the start and finish due to flight costs. It's several hundred USD cheaper per person for some reason to fly there vs most of our other stops.

If we remove anything from the trip it would likely be Italy.

We have passports and recently did a 9 day Iceland trip over the summer. That was drive, sightsee, sleep, repeat as well. We stayed in hotels that trip. It was our first time outside the North American continent and the whole family loved it so we started looking at Europe.

- Looking at mid-May, but timeline is flexible
- Parents are 67m & 68f, in good health and love walking.
- They’re very Covid-conscious, so we’ll need to be able to eat most meals outside, and don’t want to plan to be too many places that will be crazy crowded.

- Mom & I speak French, Dad speaks Spanish
- They really want to see some countryside/scenic views. Mom is a gardener and both parents are interested in conservation and native landscapes. They have asked about taking a day trip to do a hike from whatever cities we choose.

2. Foodies: my partner and I are huge foodies so would love a place with local authentic yummy food!
3. Nature / City Escapes: We want to have the best of both worlds by having easy access to nature (beaches, mountains, or lakes, etc) and major cities whenever we desire

We plan to stay in one area for a month and then move to the next if we’re able to! Budget isn’t a huge issue, but preferably nothing too costly

Would love to hear your suggestions/recommendations! Thank you :)",Europetravel
1686529787.0,Germany itinerary help,"I am traveling with my mom to Germany in mid October, her first time to Germany. I am flying in and out of Munich and traveling by train. I am trying to decide between two things for itinerary.

Day 2: Day in Salzburg. 
Day 3: Day trip from Salzburg to berechtesgaden.

People escaping the freezing cold to somewhere warm. I assumed the same would be the case for Ibiza, Magaluf, Greek islands, Algarve, etc. So I was surprised at first that summer was the high season.

Also I must note, I will be working remotely M-F on US hours, so I will have to be at my hotel/BnB from \~330-1030pm--I'm not a drinker or night owl anyway. This means I will do my touristy stuff from \~7am - 3pm daily, and side trips on weekends to nature/out of the cities. During the weeks I will need to stick to the cities so I can have reliable wifi for work.

Stuff I really want to do on side trips/non work days - bike rides through countryside/vineyards, hill towns, nature, hiking, etc. During the week, city stuff is easy enough to figure out--I'll be doing the usual museums, parks, landmarks, and otherwise just hanging, exploring, eating and living. Since I have to work, I have made stays in a couple of cities a bit longer--Paris and Amsterdam.

Basically, I'm single M 43, looking to see the cities during weekday mornings, with nature sidetrips on the weekends. I don't party or anything, more into art, nature, music, food.

My student residence permit for Belgium expired on 30 November 2022. Starting then I was on my 90 days. I exited the Schengen area on 23 January 2023 through Germany. So far, that's 55 days.

I'm re-entering the Schengen area through Belgium on 22 April 2023, and the plan is to stay in the area until 2 June 2023. That's 42 days. The result (so my visa calculator tells me) is that I'll have altogether stayed 97 days within a 180-day period.

However, when I re-enter Belgium in April, I'll be on a new passport. Can I just pretend that the first stay never happened, and thereby evade the 90/180 rule? Or is there something else that I'm completely missing...e.g., maybe my last date of entry into Belgium is saved in Belgium's immigration computer system or something? I guess another way to put my question is: does border control currently rely entirely on entry/exit stamps in order to determine whether you've over-stayed?

I'm thinking that even if Belgium knows when I last entered, they won't know when I left the Schengen area (since I left through a different Schengen country). So, since my new passport means my full travel history will not be visible to border control, I could also just make something up about when I left.

My mom and I will be in Europe for two weeks in January, flying into London then heading to France, Switzerland and Germany before she flies out of Munich and I head over to western Germany. Our draft itinerary is below, for any generous traveler willing to point out possible blunders or adjustments. But the main choice we're trying to make is between heading down to Marseille and Nice for four days from Paris before we head up to Annecy and Zermatt, or going east from Paris to Metz and Strasbourg before venturing down to Zermatt. We're looking for small, charming towns rather than big cities and are looking for hostels or cozy, modest accommodations for the whole trip. We're planning on buying train tickets within countries themselves and not using Eurail, although we do have our train tickets for London -> Paris and the glacier express. So far, we've been using Omio to find train/bus routes.

Is southern France, a famous summer destination, a worthy place to visit in the winter? Or is committing to the Bavarian winter wonderland thematic for the time of year? We're not partiers and are looking for good walking tours and museums to offset the numerous hours we'll spend in cafes drinking coffee and eating croissants. What are things we should know about either region at the time of year? Any strong thoughts on which region might be a better fit for us?

Another thing we've been wanting some advice on is what to do between Chur and Regensburg (traveling via train or bus). We've been thinking about Memmingen, but are there any other delightful small towns you all would recommend staying a night or two in?

1667717144.0,"The best ""Surprise Weekend"" for my friends","Hello !

We have a concept with my friends for several years : the surprise weekend.

One of us organize a week end trip for everyone. No one, except the organizer, know where we will go and what we will do. We all give 500-700€ to one of us.

We have an appointment 2 hours before the departure at the airport/train station and the organizer reveals the secret by giving us a goodie with the male of the destination (cap, tee shirt, etc).

We have been to Barcelona, Stockholm, Prague, Lisbon, Riga, Athens, Djerba, Canaries Islands and Magaluf.

We have made a lot of activities : quad bike, bobsleigh, shooting range, camels, jet ski, many nightclubs, ski, water park, etc.

Today, I am looking for unforgettable destinations, activities or accomodations to surprise them (it's my turn soon).

Here is a scenario I thought of :
- Appointment close to a airport
- I told them I won't be there and there will be people who will help them 
- I will be there, disguised with silicon mask
- People will blindfold them and tell them we will travel by private plane
 - They will take the private plane, but the plane will come back after 1 hour, to pretend we have made a long trip
- A military truck will wait, and everyone will jump into the truck, blindfolded
- The truck will bring us to a helicopter then they will have to  jump in the water to reach the shore
- A boat will stand us to make a cruise to Valencia in Spain
- We will travel to do the Tomatina in Valencia (the main event of the trip)

During the trip, we will stop at nice cities and biking, do a ""making cocktail masterclass"", etc.

Before the departure, I would like to send them letters with special role to play during the trip, as Werewolves Game or Killer Game.

I would like to make a teaser video to give them clues.

Obviously this is kind of a ridiculous list up-front, but that's just from going on Google maps and seeing what struck my fancy and making a path out of it.

I figured I could theoretically spend 45 days in - 45 days out - 45 days in etc. to never go over the limit, but that means I have to complete the first leg of the trip (to the UK) in 45 days. The last part too, but that's a bit far away right now. So what can I skip? What would you recommend if I wanna maintain spontaneity and not stress the fuck out, but still go through this general path and see as much as I can? Is that even a good goal?

I’m from Australia, will be 20 yrs old and will hopefully have 25k aud saved up when i leave australia. i’m not overly fussed on where i would live, would love opinions on this about where would be a good, cheapish place to get a job, live and be able to make friends. what’s the best process to do this. this is a very loose plan atm",Europetravel

Are people just rolling the dice and buying tickets to places that require long quarantines or don't allow travel at all... in the hopes the policy will change?

I’m just hoping for some inspiration from your past experiences.  


My wife and I are looking for somewhere in Europe to spend a week’s vacation relaxing & reading in July. Our criteria is generally:  


* Good weather (ideally not scorching but it’s July, I get it)
* On a body of water for swimming (sea/lake)
* In / near a town with enough going on to keep us occupied in the evenings (bars/restaurants etc)
* Maybe one or two things in the local area worth day tripping to (though we mainly want to relax)
* Not too busy / hectic
* Good value for money
* Ideally not in Spain/France/Italy - we want to go somewhere new
* Reasonably accessible (i.e within an hour or so of a major airport) - preferably without a hire car.
* No more than two different locations within the week (i.e. we’re not against relocating half way but we want to spend 3-4 days min in each place)  


*Just for some added context…*  
Our starting point has been one of Sardinia/Sicily/Dubrovnik. We can find reasonable places in each, they seem to have a good mix of things to do/places to eat & drink nearby, but they are also relatively expensive.   


I read about Kotor and considered splitting it with a few days in Dubrovnik, but I also read on Wikivoyage that the lake isn’t really suitable for swimming, which put me off.

1699585903.0,What would a smart traveller do in this situation? Book directly w the airlines or not so fast?,"Here’s my little situation and the pertinent facts.  

  
I’m in the early stages of planning a June 2024 trip to Europe.  As a general rule, we almost always book our flights directly w the airlines.  

For this trip, my flight from Canada to Europe is simple and straight forward.  The question I have doesn’t pertain to that flight.  My little conundrum pertains to my flights within Europe after I initially land.

Here’s the deal: A few days after landing in Europe, I need a one way ticket to destination X and the ONLY way to get to this destination is to book TWO separate flights on TWO separate airlines which are completely unrelated to each other.

  
If I book the flights thru Expedia, I will save hundreds of dollars essentially booking the two flights on one itinerary but I obviously would not be booking directly w either airline and I would not have the peace of mind that comes w booking directly w the airlines.  


My second option is to book two separate flights directly thru these two separate airlines and pay much more money but I’d have the peace of mind of booking directly with the airlines.    


Or would I?

My conundrum here is even if I go w the second option in order to have the peace of mind of booking directly with the airlines (albeit two separate airlines), and even if I also pay considerably more for that peace of mind, it essentially comes w precious little peace of mind.   
I say this because if, for example, the first flight is cancelled or is late in arriving or anything else happens that prevents me from making the second flight, there is nothing the second airline can really do for me.  

What would you do?   
Is this a case where, because of the circumstances, travellers who usually book directly with the airlines should perhaps strongly consider going w Expedia because the peace of mind we normally get from booking directly w the airlines just isn’t realistically there?

1696551745.0,Europe honeymoon itinerary,"Hi,

Looking for some feedback on our planned 4-week Europe honeymoon trip.

This is our first time in Europe and our plan has ended up mainly focused around Italy, including a planned group trip, going May 2024. The group trip as we're not experienced travellers and might help us get comfortable (it also sounds very nice). The last 3rd we wanted to include a few different countries so we're planning to spend a few nights in Vienna, then Interlaken through to London. 

We've always wanted to see a lot of Italy but my main concern is if the 3-night visits will not feel like enough time for the other countries. We'll be able to see a bit of both north and south Italy which will be great but maybe feels a little imbalanced? 

Also thinking it would be worth adding a few nights in Paris, as we'll probably going through there anyway. 

We are planning to travel between cities by train. 

1. 11-night group trip travelling around southern Italy & sicily
2. 2 nights Rome
3. 3 nights Florence
3. 2 nights Venice
4. 3 nights Vienna
5. 3 nights Interlaken

My local airport flys to Amsterdam, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt all year round so these would be the easiest for me to get to. Could possibly fly into Brussels from a different airport.

Which of these would be easiest. I'm also open to other suggestions. Thanks in advance.

Another thing I'm worried about is luggage. I know most hotels and airbnbs work with check in and check out times at around 10AM-2PM, so what do people do with their luggage when they still have the rest of the day in the city? Is it possible to leave your luggage and pick it up by midnight or so?

1694471706.0,"Concerned about overstaying, risk or paranoia?"," Hello everyone! My situation is a bit long to explain, so read it if you have time only.

Tldr: Schengen count Entered 03/02 left 17/03; entered 20/03 left 06/04. Entered 06/07. Can I leave on 21/09 without risk for overstaying?

Please don't judge me for asking this, I might be a little bit overreacting or paranoic, but I just wanted to see what people who understand this would say.

So I have a non-EU and non-Schengen passport, okay, which means I am allowed to be in Schengen for 90 days in every 180 period. This is a general fact/rule so it's nothing specific.

This spring, I had to go to Schengen for 2 months, for a study visit. I travel often with NGOs and projects related to my internships and work, since I study International Relations, so I wanted to get a visa for my stay in Czechia, because otherwise I was going to spend 60 from the 90 allowed days and limit my future travels for a few months. The Embassy denied my request for visa, since the stay was less than 3 months, and I could just go as a tourist, which I did, although it was a study visit.

So I was there from 03/02 to 06/04 (-2 days in March when I left, but that doesn't change much in the calculations) ---> then I was outside of Schengen for exactly 90 days.

Meanwhile I had to renew my passport. So I don't have these info in my new passport.

On the 91st day, 06/07, I am reentering Schengen in Germany for another student exchange program, that lasts 3 months. Again, visa wasn't issues because the program lasts less than 3 months. So I went by purpose, a week later than the planned day.

I asked one officer who told me that since I have new passport, it doesn't matter, how long I stayed In February/March, but that is sus to me.

Now I am planning to leave, and counting the days from 06/07 I can stay until 03/10, however I'm really paranoid since on the page ninety/180 for calculating the stay, after this Thursday, each of my day will be 90th in the 180 frame (as each day one day adds to my count and one removes from March/April, don't ask how but previously the days were ...88,89.) So this 90th scares me somehow. Although it's like 70/80ish day since my last enter from July 6th.

I want to leave next week but this concerns me and I am thinking to book last minute tickets to leave in 2 days.

My doubts are, in case this is somehow miscalculated by my side or I don't know, what can be the possible consequences, given all the circumstances in my case, and the type of my stays?

I am coconcernedecause I have to go to the America later in October for one program and I am afraid of an entry ban, that could affect me getting there since every way is through major European airports. In this case I don't know if it's possible to transit in EU with Schengen ban (potentially).

And now (you will judge me) I went to ask in the officials, and they confirmed that I can stay. So this is either a risk or my irrational fear.

I can't find whether Turkey actually requires a Titer test or not for dogs travelling with an EU passport. Online it says they do on some sites, and not on others. Others say yes from some countries and no from others. So all of the answers are out there and i've no idea which one is correct.


I've read that returning to the EU isn't a problem if our dog took the test in the EU, even if we're still ûnder 180 days from his Titer test being taken. I can't find information on how long i'd need to wait after the test to enter Turkey. 



[This website says](https://www.pettravel.com/passports_bloodtitertest.cfm):

> The countries requiring the blood titer test require that it be done vary between 30 days and 180 days before entering the country. The timing varies as to the country to which you are traveling. The waiting period until entry begins on the day the blood sample was drawn by the veterinarian.

If Turkey was 30 days we could still make the trip. If its 180 days we have a big problem.

To give a little more information, we're based in Portugal and our dog had his latest booster 15 days ago. If we drive slow this could still work. 


ChatGPT insists:

> As of my last update in September 2021, if you are traveling from an EU country or a ""Listed Third Country"" (countries with harmonized rules for pet travel), Turkey recognizes the EU pet passport as a valid document for entry. In this case, if your pet's EU pet passport shows a valid rabies vaccination, a separate rabies titer test (FAVN test) is generally not required for entry into Turkey.



[This website](https://www.pettravel.com/immigration/turkey.cfm#:~:text=A%20rabies%20titer%20test%20is,quarantine%20at%20the%20owner's%20expense.) says we can enter Turkey as soon as we receive the results of the Titer test

> A rabies titer test is required for cats and dogs entering Turkey. Blood samples must be processed at an approved lab. Your pet can enter Turkey as soon as acceptable results are received.

1682003718.0,First Trip to Europe,"Hello everyone, this is my first post on this sub! I am making this post because me and my girlfriend decided to book some flights to and from London for October (2nd to 18th). We leave Puerto Rico (our home) on the 2nd and arrive the next day in London at 11 AM. So far we have only booked the flights but after that we've been having a hard time planning an itinerary that we are 100% sure on, since this is our first time we have a lot of things on our bucket list and can't choose a region/plan for the trip! 

Our original plan was to spend about 4 nights (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th) in London, and then take a train to Brussels (cheaper than to Paris directly), from there we would stay about 5 nights (7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th) probably in middle point where we can easily travel between Amsterdam, Bruges, and the Netherlands countryside. Afterwards we'd take a train to Paris from Brussels or Amsterdam on Thalys and stay for a few nights, although my partner is not really interested in Paris and I just mostly want to see the city, eat something and walk around. So we'd be there about 4 nights (12th, 13th, 14th, 15th). Then the 16th we'd make ourselves back to London for two more nights (16th, 17th) and fly out on the 18th, I was also considering changing our return flight to Paris since I booked main cabin with Delta and the difference in fares is negligible from what I saw. This was our first plan...

After discussing the first plan to death, we started researching some more countries and actually got very excited for train rides in the Alps and Northern Italy. So then we started discussing the best way to get to Switzerland from London and came up with two itineraries: one with a direct flight and one where we take trains only and do 1-2 night stays in places along the way. For the flying itinerary we'd stay in London for about 4 nights (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th), take a plane to Zurich and stay in Switzerland, probably near Bern, for about 4 nights (7th, 8th, 9th, 10th) and then take a train to northern Italy and stay there for about 5 nights (11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th) and then we'd make our way back to London and stay for 1-2 nights before our flight home (I am also considering just moving our departure flight to somewhere in Italy that would be low on price difference to skip this return to London). 

The alternative route I was thinking for this itinerary would be to stay in London like before (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th), then take a train to Brussels and stay for the day (7th), take a late train to Paris and stay for 1-2 nights (7th, 8th) as I said before my partner is not really interested in Paris and I mostly want to go just to see the city a bit, eat at a cafe, and walk around, not really do many of the touristy things. Afterwards we'd make our journey across eastern France into Switzerland where we'd stay for about 4 nights (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) and finally we probably go to northern Italy and stay the rest of the trip (13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th) and change our departure flight to leave from Italy.

Do these itineraries sound feasible in the time we have? I was also considering changing our departure date to a bit later probably around the 20th or 21st, would that be enough time?

1626505421.0,Planning big trip to Germany and neighboring countries; questions about border crossing and covid?,"Hi all!

Excited to be vaxxed and finally traveling again. The plan was to rent a car and drive across Germany as well as hop into Switzerland, Belgium and possibly the Netherlands for a bit. Does anyone know if border crossing will be a feasible? I have my vax card of course... But will I be turned away at any borders being a US citizen? I plan to fly into Germany, so that will be my European country of origin.

Also, does anyone know if the majority of museums and stuff are closed? It would be a shame to not get to see museums. I don't care too much about dining or clubbing, COVID affecting the museums is the biggest worry for me.

1626130862.0,Social backpacking situation in Europe,"I'm a 30 years old male, very social dude, and I like the combination of hiking in nature and making new friends on the trails or at hostels.

My impressions so far from traveling Iceland and Finland is that hostels barely have guests staying at them, not to say solo-travelers like me.

Now, these are pretty expensive countries to solo-travel in, so I guess most young solo-travelers like me with an average income probably can't afford it right after this covid financial crisis.

My plan though is to start traveling in Austria, Southeast Switzerland and North Italy in August, mainly hiking in the Alps with night stays at hostels. Do you think that the situation there is different? Will I be able to socialize there?

I solo-traveled New Zealand, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Prague, USA and Canada, and the socializing situation was never bad like that in either of these trips.

1596731807.0,Question from an American Traveling to Portugal as of 8/1,"Hi everyone,

I'm planning to travel to Portugal this fall and I wanted to have a clear understanding of the language around the travel restrictions. I've done some extensive research online, but I couldn't find anything definitive due to vague verbiage.

I am a U.S. citizen currently residing in the U.S. and I understand that I am currently not allowed in the country via a flight originating from the U.S. to Portugal. My question is around this statement (updated 8/1) from Visit Portugal:

Air travel to and from Portugal is allowed to:

* European Union countries;
* Schengen Associated Countries - Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland – and the United Kingdom;
* Australia, Canada, China, South Korea, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay.

Similar information can be found under TAP Air's advisory (updated 7/31) as well:

As per the directive of the Portuguese Government (Decree Law no. 7595-A / 2020, of July 31), entry into Portuguese territory is only authorized for:

* Passengers on flights from countries belonging to the European Union, countries associated with the Schengen Area (Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland) and the United Kingdom under the terms of the Departure Agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom (regardless of nationality of the passenger);
* Passengers on flights from countries whose epidemiological situation is in accordance with Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/912, of 30 June 2020, namely Canada and Morocco;

I'm particularly interested in the part in which it read ""regardless of nationality."" Does this mean that I would be able to go through the U.K. (or any of the third countries as long as I quarantine) and ultimately travel to Portugal?

If you have a clear answer to this (or better yet, experience!), I'd love to know. Thanks for reading and for your help!",Europetravel

1699848764.0,Can't miss spots?,"Hi,

My wife and I are talking about finally doing a European vacation, something near the top if my bucket list. It's going to be a little bit of a financial stretch, so I think it's very likely to be a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Therefore, I'm trying to plan everything out meticulously and research a lot, and we're at least a year out from it happening. With all that in mind, here's my question:

What are some absolute ""can't miss"" things to see or do? 

I already have the obvious things like London, Paris, Rome, Oslo (I gotta see some fiords!) and the Swiss alps, so I'm looking for things that t might not immediately come to mind or that we simply HAVE to do that we're just forgetting (there's A LOT, I know).

I'm thinking we'll have about two weeks total there, and I know we'll likely get a Eurail pass to get around. I think we'll likely fly into London since that appears to be the least expensive flight option for us, and I know for sure we'll never have enough time to do everything we would want to, so right now I'm basically just compiling a list that will get cut down later, so right now I'm not limiting in terms of rural vs. cities or outdoor activities vs. museums and such... I'll take anything and any place that people simply think ""you GOTTA see this"", whatever it is.

1688597108.0,Austrian road trip advice,"Hello, my partner and I - late twenties/early thirties - are planning a campervan road trip around Austria at the end of September. It’s a bucket list trip for me. 
We’ve found a campervan hire service with good reviews and so are planning on flying into Vienna 21st September and going on the road for 9 days until 30th September dropping off campervan and then spending 2 further days in Austria in a hotel.
We’re looking at routes we could do that allow us to see as much of Austria as possible but also that we can relax and go for hikes/ do activities during the trip. 
Basically we’re looking advice on what things to definitely go see and what to avoid. We’re into the natural sights lakes, forests and mountains. Hikes that aren’t super strenuous (maybe ones where you can get a cable car part way up) and just having a class relaxing time. 
We’re also big foodies so recommendations on dishes or small little pastry’s that Austria or different parts of it are known for would be great as well. Then when we’re in Vienna a good restaurant to end the trip would be ideal. 
Really we just want to live and breathe Austria and get the whole experience. Seeing what all the areas are about and experiencing the culture and lifestyle.
Oh and also a spa on the way. We’d quite like to do an evening (I see some places do late late times) at a really nice spa just relaxing. But wouldn’t want it to eat into much day time activities where we can actually be exploring.

So yeah, like I said, the more of Austria we can see the better, but again if people would recommend focusing on a few areas given our time restraints then we’d welcome peoples input. For example the west side of Austria like Salzkammergut and Austrian Alps areas maybe we’d be better focusing our time there and then our two days in Vienna at the end.

1611151608.0,Holiday to Malta end of April,"Looking for some advice here, we have a holiday booked to Malta at the end of April 2021. Originally it was meant to happen in April 2020 but due to Covid we rescheduled our accommodation to 2021.

I am worried that due to the UK being in Lockdown and currently Malta not allowing people from the UK to travel to it that we will have to cancel our plans.

Our accommodation provider in Malta says that the cancellation policy now applies regardless of Government guidelines in the UK or Malta. That means that if we cancel now we will lose our deposit (around £300), if we cancel 65 days before our arrival we will forfeit the entire total cost. The strange thing is we are not obligated to pay the remaining balance until 30 days before we arrive so I am not sure how they would chase us for the remainder?

I'm not sure what we should do really. The accommodation provider doesn't seem willing to even entertain the idea of rescheduling the dates which does seem particularly harsh.

I cant find any travel insurance that would cover a cancellation due to Government restrictions being imposed so I guess we just carry on and hope for the best?

Any advice much appreciated.",Europetravel

Is it safe for American tourists to travel there with everything going on thats all over the news?! My husband and I spent a month last summer between london, paris, and a few places in italy. We wanted to take our son the next time we go, and Im definitely second guessing myself at the current moment. Thank you!!",Europetravel
