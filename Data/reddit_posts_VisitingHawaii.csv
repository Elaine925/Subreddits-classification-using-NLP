1709499602.0,Is 5 nights enough on Maui?,"**tldr: is in bold.** All input is greatly appreciated.

After some excellent advise from this sub, we have most of our trip planned (housing, not all the specific sites to see yet).  I made plane reservations to try to ""bookend"" the trip because every time we talked, the trip seemed to get a day longer.  We're flying into Maui, then to the BI where we will meet other family groups; the entire group will then go to O'ahu.  They'll then head home; We'll head to Kaua'i; . **We're on Maui 5 or 6 nights**, then we're solo on the BI for 4 or 3 nights before meeting other family groups for 10 nights in Kona.  We were considering 5 nights Maui to have more time to make sure we hit things on the BI that the whole family group might not want to commit to.  For example,  Papak≈çlea Green Sand Beach is definitely on our list but with 1:45 from the Kona resort each way, a 5.5 mile hike, some time on the beach, and at least one meal; it's a full day.  We're just not sure it will be one of the group's top nine day-trips.  Even if it were, something else is going to fall off.

**Our must-do's on Maui are 1) road to Hana, 2) the National Park, and 3) a boat or snorkel to Molokini.**  We're doing a camper-van on Maui.  **A 5 night itinerary would be** something like:

Day0/**Night 1**.  Land 2:30pm; **get to Ke'anae Uka before dark** with a couple of brief stops if time permits.   If we can pick up the van by about 3:30 we still should have about 3 hours on a google-says 80 minute drive to Ke'anae Uka.

Day1/**Night 2**. Down to (and past?) Hana.  Back to **Wai'anapanapa before dark**. Alternately, if we miss too much of the Road-to-Hana by going to Ke'anae Uka straight-ish from the airport, we could book two nights there and do an out and back to Ke'anae Uka for earlier start to anything we missed.

Day2/**Night 3**. Head to National Park with stops, time permitting, that were missed day 0 & 1.  **National park by noon?**  Not sure about night 3 **sleep**ing; **maybe Hosmer**.

Day3/**Night 4.  All day at the National park.  Likely same night site as night 3 but may head towards the south west coast** (Maui Honey Bee?)**.**

Day4/**Night 5**.  Explore the south west cost with a **day trip to Molokini** for boat and/or snorkel.  **Sleep same as night 4** or maybe head back to Kahului, for a flight about noon on day 5.

**Is 5 nights enough?**

Bonus question

If we need to do the 6th night on Maui, how/where would you add it?

We're there 6 nights, staying at Hilton Hawaiian Village. We're coming off of Eastern time, so the time change is going to hit us hard on this first part of our trip.

I'm looking at dedicating two days of our itinerary, including a lot of beach hopping and snorkeling one day, then Waimea Bay, Waimea Falls, and Toa Luau the second day. 

For a 6 night stay on the island, do you think two days at North Shore makes sense? It seems like there's a lot of unique beaches that will take more than one day to explore, but are they worth committing to a second day of 2+ hours of driving round trip?

Hey, are the orange lights in the sky over the Pacific to the west around 9pm every night common? They seem to be coming from the general area of Johnston Atoll or Johnston island. We are staying on the west coast of Hawaii, in Kona.

Our family is on vacation and noticed them 3 nights in a row, around from 9pm to 930 and can't figure out what they are.

They're orange-ish in color, and seem to appear, change directions, before fading away. There's tons of them at a time. Looking through binoculars almost too many to count. My brother has some really crappy pictures of them because they're so dim if people want to see. 

We are convinced they aren't starlink, or satellites, as they aren't geostationary nor do they traverse a straight line. We also aren't fully convinced they are drones as the speed they travel would be impossible for a drone, especially at the distance we are viewing them from and the altitude changes they are making (unless someone has seen them and can confirm they're drones) We are pretty avid skywatchers back home and haven't seen anything like this. 

For example, they will be travelling towards the right in the sky, before abruptly changing direction and flying straight upwards, and then fading away. We have also spotted them in pairs or trios, following each other or crossing paths. There also seems to be a flash in the sky in the same area around the time the lights start. Any ideas? We can't be the only ones noticing this. Military tests? 

Thanks! This is a genuine question, not a troll. We are just looking for answers from those more informed.
***********
TLDR Edit as those reading seem to be misinterpreting what I have typed:

The amber/orange lights we are seeing are NOT traveling in straight lines.

I understand starlink and satellites DO travel in straight lines/appear to wobble or jump due to atmospheric conditions. 

The lights we are seeing, again, are NOT traveling in one continuous straight line. They are completely changing course, NOT wobbling. They are traveling north, then abruptly turning and traveling west, for example. ",VisitingHawaii

Also, I have never surfed, but grew up in the ocean and bodyboarded often. I wouldn‚Äôt mind learning to surf.

We also don't really know what island(s) we want to visit. Was originally thinking BI for a week followed by Oahu (primarily for Pearl Harbor), but after reading this sub I'm reevaluating our ideas.

Want to do beaches, tasty food, and maybe some low key snorkling if we can figure out how to take turns between activity and watching baby. Probably some light hiking with baby strapped to us -- but unsure about visiting volcano related areas with baby even though that would be neat.

My main questions are on the eastern part. I'm aiming to arrive early enough in Hilo (coming from Kauai) to have some chill activities. The next day would be devoted to Volcanoes. I'm finding it hard to understand what's doable in that shorter time the first day. I read about some scenic drives, particularly Kalapana to Isaac Hale, I'd love to see a black sand beach. But that seems pretty far from the NP. **Are there good lodging options that have** **decent proximity to both?** (idk how much traffic will be a factor)

Finally, I'll also be driving over to Kona after the day at Volcanoes, and so I didn't want to spend *the entire time* in the car (\*my final day, I'm planning on a tour to summit Mauna Kea, which is more road trip, too). Thoughts on a 5-day Big Island itinerary in general that hits both coasts?

1708884449.0,Visiting Kauai in early March for the first time and have a few questions,"1) I know it's not ideal for Kauai, but I normally prefer to take public transit, rideshares, or book shuttle bus group tours on vacation. Since finding out that on Kauai the buses are apparently very limited or don't run on Sundays and how hard and expensive it can be to find rideshares though, I will have to rent a car for at least Sunday to get around. In particular I plan to visit Hanalei to look around the town and beach and Port Allen to park a few hours for a sunset boat tour on a Sunday. So I'm wondering if it will be difficult to find free/cheap parking in these places, and if so, any tips for finding parking there?

2) Recommended last minute car rentals around Lihue? I thought about Turo, but am not seeing many good options near Lihue for a cheap compact car. Am leaning toward SIXT, but have read a combination of good word and nightmare stories about them, so not sure. I'll be booking through my credit card for free rental insurance. 

3) I have a helicopter tour booked with Jack Harter in early March, but the weather forecast is showing cloudy and around 50% chance of rain for most days. Is it likely my helicopter tour will have to be canceled/rescheduled?

4) My luggage is light and it looks to be less than a couple miles of mostly flat walking to get to Kauai Palms Hotel from Lihue airport. Is it safe from road traffic to walk to and from the airport in the dark? This is already one of my most expensive trips ever so I'm looking to save money where I can, but if people insist this is dangerous to walk I'll try to find a way to get a taxi or something. I'd really rather not have to pay for a car rental multiple days if I can help it.

I will be cruising into Honolulu in April and then flying home to New Zealand on the night after. 

So far I‚Äôve got a very basic list of itenary/things 
I want to do, but not sure how practical it would be to achieve? 

Staying at Waikiki for the one night, but have no car if it helps (nor do I plan on driving) 

Friday: 

Disembark from cruise 

Visit pearl harbour 

Aloha Kai Luau OR diamond head Luau 

Stroll around Waikiki after 

Saturday:

Try loco moco. 

Either diamond head/Koko trail/Manoa falls 
- I am a reasonably fit individual, travelling solo and love hiking/nature. 

Koko trail seems to be most picturesque views? But also not as easy to get to from Waikiki without a car but also happy to take advice 

Maybe a quick stroll around Waikiki/Honolulu if I have time. 

Fly home 

Thanks in advance,

I'm planning a 6-day family vacation on the Big Island (mom with 2 teenage boys).  I'm really intrigued by the King Kamehameha Hotel and would like to stay there, but it looks like there's not much to do in Kona.  I'm thinking I will split my trip and spend part of it there in Kona, and the other part in Hilo or Volcano.  I was originally thinking I'd split it directly in half, but I'm starting to wonder if I should just do two days in Kona and four in Hilo.  

Things I want to do (I can't afford all of these, so I'll have to narrow it down eventually):

Swim (maybe skimboard?) at the beach, snorkel

Swim under waterfalls (suggestions for easy ones to get to?  My boys are not big on long hikes).  

Go ziplining

Rent bicycles and cycle somewhere... haven't decided where yet

Go to a black sand beach (is there one with soft black sand that is good for swimming?  It seems like they're more for looking at.  I get impatient just viewing sights- I like to be doing something.  

Go SUPing or kayaking, maybe take surf lessons

Visit VNP (I know my boys are going to moan and groan at this one, but I must see it).  

I have no interest in the Manta ray activity- large groups of people freak me out.  I can't handle museums.  Stargazing sounds amazing but I'm getting old and will probably be in bed by then.

More picturesque beaches, better backdrop, more impressive mountains. I didn't get to hike as much in big island so I can only speak for Oahu and the hiking there was great too.

If the transit system is good, that's a bonus!

My wife is a foodie while I have a lot of dietary restrictions, so having good restaurants (for her) and grocery stores (for me) is ideal.

At the South shore, I'm having a hard time deciding between the Grand Hyatt, Sheraton, Kola, or K'oa Kea. During our time there, we would like to go snorkeling, hiking, coffee tasting and we love animals so any kind of wildlife tour would be great. Bonus points if they offer snorkeling classes!

 My family wants to visit Hawaii this year for about a week but I‚Äôve told them I don‚Äôt want to attend because despite tourism being a large contributor to Hawaiis economy/money it‚Äôs also one of the main contributors to the growing problems there. 
Water shortages, environmental degradation, housing crisis/ homelessness, and dilution of Native culture ( building resorts on ancient burial grounds ), etc.

1708222440.0,1 Week on Big Island - Hilo Trip Report,"# Hello all. We (26F and 30M) spent a week on the Big Island staying at the Grand Naniloa Hotel in Hilo. We had an amazing time. Before the trip, I asked for itinerary advice here: Week in Hilo - Itinerary Advice :  [Week in Hilo - Itinerary Advice : VisitingHawaii (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/19bzjfu/week_in_hilo_itinerary_advice/) The following is my trip report for our duration, hope it's helpful for future visitors:

**Day 1 | Wednesday -** The airport in Hilo is my favorite airport I've ever been to. It's tiny, accessible, and friendly. We landed after 9 pm, ubered to our hotel \*See note below on rental cars\* and ate at the hotel bar restaurant before crashing out.

**Day 2| Thursday** \- Breakfast at Pauls Place. 10/10 and regret not coming here again on the trip. Reservation only, as it's only three available tables and a hot plate, but they usually open up. Next was Kaulaniapia Falls via   [Exclusive Access to the Private Kulaniapia Falls (5 hours, $49) (lovebigisland.com)](https://www.lovebigisland.com/tours/waterfall-daypass-kulaniapia/) . My favorite waterfall the whole trip, beautiful area, perfect for the first day. Affordable rentals are provided on-site, I did the paddleboard. Changed at the hotel for snorkeling at Carlsmith Beach Park. One of our snorkel masks broke and we weren't seeing any fish, so we dipped lol. Stopped by  Ali‚Äòi Ice  [Ali‚Äòi Ice (aliiice.com)](https://www.aliiice.com/)  for some great ice cream and paletas. Ate dinner at Moon and Turtle restaurant. I see the draw, but I was disappointed and wouldn't return, I think it was overpriced.

**Day 3 | Friday** \- Volcano National Park Day. Let ourselves sleep in a little and got to the park by noon. Visitor Center, Steam Vents, Kilauea Iki Trail, lunch at Ohelo Cafe, coffee stop at the Volcano Lodge, Chain of Craters Road all the way to the H≈çlei Sea Arch. We walked towards the collection of palm trees slightly off-trail, and on the cliffs looking at the arch, my boyfriend proposed. The perfect day. Dinner at the hotel lounge with live music, and phone calls with family.  [Proposed 02/02/2024 : EngagementRings (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngagementRings/comments/1ahrr7i/proposed_02022024/)

**Day 4 |Saturday** \- Kona day. Breakfast at the Booch Bar before heading out. I really wanted to go to the Hilo Farmers Market this day, but the weather on almost the whole island sucked, so we went to the one sunny and non-blustery area: Kona, via Saddle Road. Specifically, Magic Sands Beach and Kahalu'u Beach Park were clear. We looked at Magic Sands and drove to Kahalu'u to see if it was any better. It wasn't, it was packed as well so we went back and had a great time at Magic Sands Beach. We drove up through Ali'i Drive, hit the Kona market stalls, and grabbed coffee at Kona Coffee while waiting for Kanaka Kava to open. My fiance wasn't feeling the vibes of the place, and ended up at Fosters Kitchen nearby. It was fine, I wish I was able to try Kanaka Kava though lol. Drove back to Hilo.

**Day 5 |Sunday -** We booked a helicopter ride at 9 AM, but as the weather was iffy, they gave us the option to opt out or reschedule and we decided to opt out with a refund. Breakfast at Hawaiian Style Cafe (I'd skip), grabbed fruit at the Farmers Market. Drove to Rainbow Falls and Boiling Pots. Wanted to do Pe'epe Falls, but didn't understand how to get there. Drove to the Kaumana Caves, but as we pulled in a family was walking out saying it was just dark and not worth it, so we took their word for it. We drove back to do some laundry and change for Mauna Kea. When we got there, a couple was asking if anyone could take them to the summit as they didn't have AWD. It was nice having company on the way up and down. The summit was amazing for sunset.

**Day 6 |Monday -** North Island down to Kona. All day we kept saying, ""immaculate"". Finally got coffee at Paradise Coffee Roasters. Such great service there, lots of samples if you're a coffee person. Fiance went across the street to Puna Chocolate Co. for a latte. Stopped in Honokaa for sunscreen and lotion, water. Drove to Waipi'o Fruit Shack, immaculate vibes. Ate fruit out of a pineapple, laying in a hammock, next to sunbathing dogs overlooking the ocean. Despite us not being huge on overlooks, we thought Waipi'o looked worth it and it was. Beautiful. The North might be my favorite area, so pretty. Stopped in Waimea to change into swimsuits and grab some snacks. Drove to Hapuna Beach. If you are looking for that truly sandy expansive beach on the Big Island, this is the one. Swam here for a good while, finished up and drove down to Kailua-Kona. Impromptu stop for bathrooms and burgers at Ultimate Burger. We booked a manta ray snorkel tour via  [Manta Ray Night Snorkel ¬ª Hawaiian Double Hull Canoe Adventure | Keauhou Bay | Kailua Kona | Big Island Hawaii (anelakaiadventures.com)](https://www.anelakaiadventures.com/) , it was quite the experience and a great option as it's only 6-8 people per trip or something, no motor, family business. We stopped to see a friend at the Magic Sands Beach Grill but missed her. The food and service here are amazing - def get the banana bread dessert. Pretty view as it's right on the water, great ambiance. Drove back to Hilo via Saddle Road. Realize I left my wallet and bag at the grill in Kona, classic.

**Day 7| Tuesday -** Last full day. 9 am horseback ride tour via  [Wailea Horseback Adventure Ride & Waterfall Swim at Umauma Falls](https://waileahorsebackadventure.com/) . We were looking forward to this and it didn't disappoint. Got wraps and coffee at What's Shakin' Shack just down the road. We decided to skip Akaka Falls because we were a little short on gas and just figured it wouldn't beat Kulaniapia Falls lol. Did the Hawaii Tropical Garden, pricey but beautiful. Went back to Puna Chocolate Co. for coffee and a chocolate bar (went with the Horchata one). Took Saddle Road back to the Grill in Kona, was able to get my bag and see my friend. Got dinner and banana bread dessert again. Immaculate hospitality. Drove back to Hilo to pack up.

**Day 8 | Wednesday** \- Flight left at 6 am. See note on rental cars below.

*Rental Car Notes: I'd recommend Discount Hawaii Car Rental | Maui Car Rentals Honolulu Kona Kauai Hilo Waikiki  or via your airlines which is what we did, got a brand new Jeep), make sure you land before 9:00 pm as this is when the car rental services close. We had to Uber to our hotel and pick up the car the following morning. She informed us that on our last day, since we flew out at 6 am, we could just drop off our car and keys into the dropbox if they weren't open yet, and in general, not to arrive very early before our flight and she was right. Security to sitting at our gate took maybe 5 minutes.*

*Not noted above: We stopped at Makani's Magic Pineapple shack for Ube soft serve (yum). I just don't remember what day.*

*Trip planning: Make your itinerary flexible for weather changes. Remember that if it's raining where you're at, it might not be 10 minutes down the road. We adjusted almost every day by pulling from or combining other days, working around our reservations and tours. Highly reccomend*  [*Wanderlog: travel itinerary, vacation & road trip planner*](https://wanderlog.com/home)  *for trip planning.*

*Restaurants: It was helpful to know what was nearby that was well rated, in case we wanted to eat or sub something else in/out for convenience. We had a daily hotel stipend and tried to use that often.*

*Hilo: If we had kids, we would likely stay in Kona for convenience. For this trip and our itinerary, we loved Hilo. Laid back and slow pace. My fiance was stationed on Oahu, we have both been to Maui, and we would both prefer the Big Island if we were to ever move. Don't overlook staying outside of Kona if you're on a budget.*

1708191628.0,Adults only honeymoon in Hawaii,"Hello,

I'm planning my honeymoon in Hawaii in July, and i'm feeling pretty overwhelmed with choices and options. We are thinking maybe about 10 to 12 days, two island. But can't seem to decide on which ones. Neither of us are in love with the touristyness of Waikiki, but are open to going to Oahu for a couple days for the nightlife and to see pearl harbor. But this is not a must-do. For the second island, we're torn. This is where we would spend most of out time, we want beach life, slowness, local eateries, water activities and some nature/hiking would be fine, but would still want 'nightlife' to go out and have dinner and drinks. It's seems like Maui would be a great option for this, but my Fiance is concerned about the recent fires and being aware and respectful of that. So now we can't decide between Kauai and big island. We like big island for the nature, but I also see comments on reddit that it's lots of driving which we might want to avoid. Then in terms of where to stay, since this is our honeymoon, I would prefer a adults only resort, or a resort thats no so family friendly with adults only pools, or something like that, and not too crowded where we have to wake up at the crack of dawn to get a pool chair. Beachfront rooms/suites, and just generally a more luxury feel, and willing to pay a little bit more for this but preferably below the price point of Four season :).

Considering all of this, questions to reddit are,  how is it visiting Maui this year as it relates to the fires and tourists, is this a concern or is Maui an option? Kauai or Big island better based on what we're looking for? Recommendations on adults only or less family friendly resorts on any island?",VisitingHawaii

Also don‚Äôt want to visit if it‚Äôs distasteful and not worth it because of the recent fires. Here are some important things we want to do in order:

Nice beaches - bonus for water activities you can rent right on the water like kayaks, paddle boards surfing, etc 

Bicycles - we love to rent bikes and ride along oceanfront bike paths, similar to a boardwalk type thing you‚Äôd find in Southern California. Not looking for road bikes and a 10 mile ride but something leisurely for an afternoon or two with a view 

Scooters/golf kart - pretty self explanatory, it sounds fun to rent something along those lines and go for a scenic drive 

Food/drinks - we love food and love to drink! 

ATV/helicopter ride - a cool main activity something along these lines would be cool

Hiking - would love a good hike but it is nowhere near the top of our list 

Quiet is good, walkable is good - open to any resorts/hotels you can recommend, we want something nicer and private

My fiancee and I are planning a 1 week trip to Oahu in May (5 full days not counting the travel days).  We were hoping to ask some questions and get some opinions.

Hotel-wise, we're planning to book a Costco package and leaning towards the Prince Waikiki as it seems a little further from Wakiki proper and we probably value a quieter stay.  Anyone have experience with this hotel?  Or other recommendations?

We have not been to Oahu before.  What would be the must-do activities?  So far we just have Diamond Head and Pearl Harbor on the list.

I've looked through some of the luaus, and currently thinking either Nutridge or Paradise Cove.  Thoughts on either of those?

1707523226.0,Just returned from Oahu - trip report,"Just returned from a full 7 days in Oahu and thought a review of our adventures might be helpful. I started stalking this page 4 months before the vacation. So many posts and suggestions here helped shape what we did. It was a lifesaver. Background on our group: 4 adults and 2 kids. 

We approached this trip as a once in a lifetime. We wanted to be frugal where we could, but spend when it was worth it to us, if that makes sense. I also saw many times people labeled things as ‚Äútouristy.‚Äù Guess what, we were tourists so we didn‚Äôt let labels stop us. Here‚Äôs the highlights. Hope it‚Äôs helpful. 

Accommodations: We opted for a condo instead of multiple hotel rooms We stayed in Ko Olina. Condo complex had multiple pools and access to a safe beach for the kids. You would need a car for this option due to location. Very quiet, very secluded and little to no people in the pools or on the beach. There are plentiful grocery options on that side of the island. 

Car Rental: We rented a mini van. It was a great choice due to hopping in and out of the vehicle multiple times a day. It seemed to get good gas mileage. We filled up twice over 7 days. It was suggested to get gas at a Sam‚Äôs Club or Costco. We did this and saved about .50 a gallon. We used [www.discounthawaiicarrental.com/](http://www.discounthawaiicarrental.com/) after seeing the suggestion on this page. Great choice. They let you reserve and cancel without penalty. Our initial reservation was $700 for the week and about 5 weeks out from the trip the price dropped to $275. I downloaded the app on my phone and checked it every day. Needless to say, there were multiple reservations/cancellations until we settled. 

Traffic: I read somewhere on this page to prepare yourself for island time when driving around. Our group is from a land of aggressive drivers and high speed limits so I knew this would be a transition. The drivers on Oahu are kind and observe the speed limits. It was a pleasant surprise.   

Food: Had big plans to try all the food Hawaii has to offer. Quickly found out half our group were not adventurous eaters. No biggie. We did venture out to the food trucks in Haleiwa one day. Ordered from multiple trucks. Everything was excellent especially the shrimp. Share plates, the portions are huge. We had way more food than we needed.

Adventures Highlights:

Hanauma Bay: This was #1 on our list to do. I can‚Äôt say how hard tickets will be for you to get, but we had no problem.  This place was everything and more. I can only describe it as exhilarating. The snorkeling was incredible. Plenty of sea creatures to observe. The beach is big enough to accommodate everyone. We‚Äôd do this one again over and over.

Pearl Harbor: Got reservations for Arizona Memorial at 9am. This turned out to be perfect. Plenty of close parking at this time of day. We also were able to take the boat to the Arizona and then have the rest of the day to hit the other museums and monuments without feeling rushed.   We also toured the USS Bowfin, and did the Battleship Missouri Memorial. We opted not to do the Aviation Museum. All of the displays were incredible. Well worth the trip.

Dole Plantation: We arrived a few hours before closing. It was also raining heavily. Bought ponchos and made the best of it. The maze was closed so that was a bummer. Once again saw many people say this place was ‚Äútouristy.‚Äù Yep, so what. Our group had never seen a pineapple plant or how they are grown. We loved the train ride and all of the plant displays. We also ate here. Food was decent and again portions were huge. Sharing would be wise. Each time we passed the plantation over subsequent days we all agreed this was a fun visit and we learned so much.

Kualoa Ranch: We opted for the ‚ÄúHalf Day Package.‚Äù Spend the first 90 minutes seeing all the movie sights, ate an included lunch and then 90 more minutes on a catamaran out in the ocean. This package was suggested by a friend and it was a great choice. Considering a decent lunch was included in the price we thought it was a great buy. The movie sights tour was so much fun and our tour guide was amazing. The catamaran ride allowed us to venture out into the ocean and we even spotted multiple turtles.  

Waimea Falls: Honestly this one wasn‚Äôt high on our list but we had friends who were on the island at the same time as us and wanted to meet up. It‚Äôs very developed and clean. The hike/walk to the top was very manageable or you can opt for a shuttle ride up/down. There is a snack bar, life jacket station, bathrooms and changing rooms up at the falls. We had hiked up to a much more remote waterfall the day before so all of this was somewhat unexpected. The kids loved swimming here and said the water was really cold.  Call ahead for swimming conditions.    

Diamond Head: We had a 10am reservation to visit here. The kids loved the thought they were inside a volcano. The big attraction here is the hike. We lucked out with an overcast day. The hike itself isn‚Äôt long but the trail is rocky, uneven and narrow. You‚Äôre also passing people headed the opposite direction.  It took us about an hour to make the trip to the top and back down.

Outrigger Waikiki Beachcomber - Deluxe Ocean View

Hyatt Regency Waikiki - Oceanfront Room

We're looking for a hotel with an ocean view, good location, and modern looking rooms. The beachcomber has great looking rooms, central location, but the view from the hotel doesn't look all that great. The Hyatt Regency, from what I can tell through videos, has phenomenal ocean views, but dated room and huge resort like hotel which we feel is a minus because of how busy everything looks. Also when reading through reviews it seems like theres always something not working in a room.

About me:

I've been to Maui 3 times and Kauai once over the last 4 years (usually for my bday in April) but decided to switch it up a bit this year. Visiting from OC, CA if that matters. Very comfortable traveling solo. I'm staying in Waikiki off the Ala Wai Bay, mostly doing public transit, will prob do day car rentals to explore north shore/other areas.

Not interested in guided tours/tourist traps/luaus (did all that on my first trip to HI years ago) but also want to be respectful and not intrude on any ""locals only"" spots. Mostly into beaches, hiking, views, art, farmers markets, live music, bars, etc. Trying to find a balance of exploring but also taking time to just chill.

I saw the extensive list of veg food options in the wiki, will incorporate as many that make sense logistically but open to any other suggestions (honestly SO excited for vegan spam musabi from Down to Earth, had no luck finding any in Kauai last year).

1707453567.0,Big Island logistics question- early AM flight to Kauai,"Hi all! Excited I found this sub and am in earlier stages of planning an unexpected trip to Hawaii June 22-July 7. A friend is getting married on Oahu 7/5, so we decided to attend! We are a mid-30s couple, well-traveled but not resort/beachy people and enjoy very physically active, high energy vacations with lots of hiking and nature. Therefore, overall plan is to spend majority of time on Big Island and Kauai, with just last 3.5 days in Oahu for the wedding/relaxation. Having hard time with deciding how best to split time on Big Island - definitely want to stay in Kona and Hilo. My first thought was below plan:

* June 22: land in Kona @ 2 pm (from Phoenix)
    * Pick up rental car at airport
    * Dinner/sunset in Kona
    * Stay at Royal Kona Resort
* June 23: explore north 
    * Pololu Valley
    * Hawi for lunch
    * ?Stop at Manini‚Äôowali Beach on way back if time
    * Early light dinner in Kona
    * Night manta ray snorkel experience
    * Stay at Royal Kona Resort
* June 24: 
    * Kealakekua Bay - hike or kayak to snorkeling
    * Lunch at Shaka Tacoz 
    * ?Mamalahoa Hot Tubs and Massage 
    * Take a stargazing tour on Mauna Kea vs rent 4 Wd and go ourselves 
    * Stay at Royal Kona Resort
* June 25:
    * Hike to Makalawena Beach in AM
    * ?Two Step on Honaunau Bay for snorkeling
    * Pu‚Äôuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park
    * Kona Brewing Company 
    * Stay at Royal Kona Resort
* June 26: Road trip to Hilo
    * Drive to South Point
        * Punalu‚Äôu Bakery
    * Punalu'u Black Sand Beach
    * Hawaii Tropical Bioreserve and Garden 
    * ?Rainbow Falls if time
    * Dinner in Hilo, explore town
    * Stay at Dolphin Bay Hotel
* June 27: Volcanoes National Park
    * Kilauea Iki hike
    * Thurston Lava Tube
    * Sights along Crater Rim Drive
        * Kilauea Overlook
        * Halema‚Äôuma‚Äôu Crater
        * Steam Vents at Wahinekapu and Ha‚Äôakulamnu Suphur Banks 
    * ?Drive back to Kona, stay near airport
* June 28: flight to Lihue (Kauai) 8:19 am  (only direct flight option). 

However, it doesn‚Äôt look like there are really airport accommodations and driving back to Kona after spending all day in VNP may be exhausting‚Ä¶ prob would arrive very late and leave by 6 am‚Ä¶but I also don‚Äôt love the idea of driving right to hilo after we land on June 22? debating whether I should do like June 22-25 Kona, June 25-26 hilo, then back to Kona June 26-28 (basically move either June 24 or June 25 day to end of Big Island stay )

1707333938.0,best spot to stay for one-month visit for work at Pearl Harbor? (first time in Hawaii),"I will be visiting Hawaii for the first time from early March through early April. I will be commuting to an office on Ford Island at least 3x/week and working from my lodging on the other days. I found a place to stay in Pearl City and this seems like an obvious choice in terms of having a convenient drive to the office. From Google Maps, it seems I can even avoid the interstate and take the back roads for a quick 15-20 minute drive.

However, I also want to be able to explore as much of Oahu as possible during my visit and wonder if I would be better off staying in Kailua or Kaneohe. (I see other places in my price range near Waikiki, but I'd rather avoid the more crowded/touristy areas. Though, I definitely plan to visit Waikiki.) I am a bit reluctant in terms of having to drive on the interstate 3x/week to get to the office and a potentially longer drive, but I understand traffic is minimal on the H3 and the scenery is beautiful.

The thought of being close to beaches that I can walk to and relax after work (or even take a walk in the middle of the day for a break) is tempting. Though, I also worry I will be too relaxed and not get any work done on the days I'm not going to the office, lol. On the other hand, if I'm staying in Pearl City, maybe I will make more of an effort to check out more parts of the island and not stick close to my lodging.

Here on the east coast of the continental US, I typically work 9-5. However, I am hoping to get on an earlier schedule while in Hawaii to allow time for sightseeing. If I can end my work day around 3pm, I'm hoping I can take advantage of a quick trip each afternoon to a beach or hiking spot before sunset. Would one location versus the other be better in this regard?

Also, for longer trips on the weekend, would there be much advantage of staying in one location versus the other in terms of being a ""central"" location for exploring the island?

It also seems like there's not much in terms of restaurants/grocery stores right in Pearl City where I'd be staying, but I see it's not a far drive/bus ride from an organic grocery store and the Pearl Ridge mall. I see some restaurants in the Kailua/Kaneohe area that seem to be a short drive or bus ride away as well. Speaking of which, are the buses reliable/frequent on Oahu?

1707094787.0,Please Review My Oahu Itinerary Review,"I‚Äôm planning our family‚Äôs (me, my husband, early 20‚Äôs son) trip to Hawaii, starting with a week in Oahu at the beginning of May. This is my first and likely my only trip to Hawaii, so I‚Äôm trying to get a good variety of experiences while understanding that I can‚Äôt see and do everything and choices must be made. I‚Äôve tried to leave time each day to get back to our condo and relax on the lanai, on the beach or at the pool before dinner.

For the most part, I haven‚Äôt figured out food yet. I‚Äôll go back and fill that in. 

We have reservations at Aston Waikiki Beach Tower through Captain Cook. When I made the reservation last spring, the condo had a pool, which is one of the things we really want. A few weeks ago, I saw a notice on BT‚Äôs website that says the pool is closed November - March for emergency repairs. I know exactly how much to trust construction time estimates so I got in touch with CC, which said they‚Äôll refund me 20% for each day the pool is closed while we‚Äôre there. I just checked the BT website today and it now says the pool is closed through May. No surprise. Some pool time would be really nice. There are a few places (Alohilani, Twin Fin, Hyatt Regency and Marriott Resort and Spa) that are a very quick walk from our condo with pool passes available on Resort Pass. The refund from CC will cover the cost of a pool pass or, in some cases, a reserved daybed. I hate to pay for it and not use it at all or just drop by for half an hour. I‚Äôd rather carve out a chunk of time and call it a pool (half) day. So, if anyone has any thoughts on where to fit that in, I‚Äôd love that. 

The following items have been deliberately omitted from our plans for varying reasons; they haven‚Äôt been overlooked or forgotten:

* Pearl Harbor

* Hanauma Bay

* Surfing lessons or anything similar for my son

1707040432.0,"Looking for ideas, tricks and advice for Oahu and Maui without a car","Hi - I'm planning a trip to Hawaii later this year.  It'll be my fifth time heading over, but my partner's first time.  We're planning on staying in Waikiki for a week, and Maui (Wailea) for a week.  Every other time I've visited I rented a car, but this time we've agreed neither of us want the hassle or stress of driving overseas (e.g. not accidentally driving on the other side of the road, different road rules, miles vs KM etc).  Neither of us enjoy driving particularly - I was lucky that my ex did all the driving on previous trips!

I was hoping for some advice on activities or ideas to make the best of our trip if we're without wheels.

Out priority for the two weeks will be relaxation and enjoying the natural beauty of the island.  I think we are sorted for lazy pool days but keen to hear on any other activities.

So far we are thinking:

\- Oahu circle tour with hotel pickup  
\- Road to Hana small tour with hotel pickup  
\- Molokini crater with hotel pickup  
\- A hike near Waikiki ?  We're not in good shape but both trying to lose weight before we go.  Diamond Head or the lighthouse walk, with an Uber to-and-from the hotel seems to be the most time / cost effective.

Our Maui accommodation has a local shuttle around Wailea if needed.

Big Beach and Little Beach in Maui are some of my favourite spots in the world, but I don't think that is an option without a car.

But this- this is way too good to be true.  It's supposedly an all-inclusive offer (round-trip flight, hotel, rental car) from Costco for 7 days.  For less than $8,000?  There must be some kind of catch, or hidden fees, right?

1706905383.0,Photographers on Oahu? Looking for True to Life Bold/Vibrant Color,"Hello,

I am probably out of luck since I am a little picky due to being a long time portrait photographer myself, but I was hoping to book a photographer for a couples session for my husband and myself on our upcoming trip to Oahu. I found a couple of photographers who have the bold/vibrant true to life colors that I like in photography below:

[https://www.shannonmelekphotography.com/](https://www.shannonmelekphotography.com/)  
[https://www.peedeevisuals.com/](https://www.peedeevisuals.com/)  


I've been going down the google rabbit hole attempting to find some others I can reach out to since the two above are not available. Anyone know of any others who have work that looks like theirs? I'm struggling to find people who have a consistent portfolio similar to the above. Or really any who look like they do off camera flash well except for this guy: [https://hilifephoto.com/](https://hilifephoto.com/)  
But his portfolio does not have much to see so I am nervous about what I could expect for an entire session.    


Hoping to stay at $1,500 or below but could stretch depending on what is offered. Anyone know of anyone I should look at or should I just keep clicking ""See more"" on the google search results? Thank you!

This is not meant to sound insensitive but I have to put it in his terms for me to relay it to him. My husband and I have been looking to plan a trip to Hawaii. The idea keeps getting scrapped because he‚Äôs concerned it‚Äôs mainly swimming in the ocean and seafood. He‚Äôs okay with outdoorsy stuff like hiking which I have heard is great in Hawaii, but he needs a pretty solid balance of outside and inside time since he sunburns extremely easy. 

He can‚Äôt swim and doesn‚Äôt like seafood at all, now from my research it‚Äôs obviously not all swimming in the ocean and seafood but what are some of y‚Äôall‚Äôs recommendations for outdoorsy things, even indoorsy things, and places to eat that are accommodating to that?

1706829036.0,Trip Report - Kauai,"Long overdue but here it is, honeymoon in Kauai in May/June 2023:

I booked through Costco with the total being $4,900. Package included:

* Flight: United economy
* Transportation: Full-size car through Budget
* Hotel: Royal Sonesta Kauai Resort - Deluxe Ocean-View - King bed

I'll describe my experience and itinerary but if you want to skip to reviews, look for the bullet points.

Day 1,

Arrived around noon and, oh boy, did I feel like I traveled through time. The decor and the smell of the airport makes you feel like you're not in the 2000's. Anyways, I've heard horror stories of rentals agencies and specially Budget but maybe it was the time and day (Sunday) that caused me to experience no issues picking up our car. From arriving to the airport to being on the road in the car took less than 20 minutes.

Our first stop was Costco. Picked up bottled water, chips, lunch (poke), and other items for the trip. Second stop was Walmart for other items such as sunscreen, bug spray, and sun hats.

* Costco poke was good. I didn't find it any different than the Costco poke in the mainland. I personally was very curious about this comparison.

I wasn't sure on what to do as it was still around 1pm and check-in wasn't until 4pm. I wasn't expecting for the pick of the car to be as fast as it was. Husband suggested just trying to check in and sure enough our room was ready.

We didn't do much for the rest of the day. We did have dinner at the hotel's restaurant, and explored the hotel and surrounding area. We had been up since 2am local time so not much energy to be out and about.

Day 2,

HELICOPTER RIDE. We went with Mauna Loa no-doors at 9am. This was one of the two bookings I had and it was the most important thing I wanted to do during our trip. It was way more incredible than I thought. Rain is scary but there's no rainbows without rain and the waterfalls are fuller. Honestly, after this, I said I was ready to go home. I've seen it all!

* Note: I looked into booking the Jurassic falls company but I didn't want to risk sitting in the middle and I can't afford to book a private ride.

After, we drove south to explore the island. Our stops:

* Kauai Coffee Company. Coffee and ice cream were good, and the self-tour walk is also nice but nothing incredible. Cute photo opportunities.
* Glass beach. No. Just no. Don't stop here. There's no parking so you just park on the side of the street and hope you're fine. The walk there is not smooth. I would highly recommend that you're wearing proper shoes and have no difficulty walking in uneven roads. It will rain and it's for sure muddy. The glass is more like broken bottles glass and there's barely any. It really more looks like the backyard of the homeless people and they don't want you there. I'm sure that at some point decades ago this was a nice stop. I recommend that you skip it unless you really really want to see it yourself. It's fine if you do but don't. Lots of beaches in California look like what this is supposed to look like so plan to go there instead.
* Spouting Horn. Cute stop. A bit crowded but tolerable.
* Poipu and Puka Dog Hawaiian Style Hot Dogs. Hot dogs and lemonade were good. In retrospect, I do wish I had spent more time at the beach. This was a quick stop. We did see turtles and a monk seal but to me it was more of a sad scene than anything. They're protected so they are roped and crowded as if they were a crime scene. I wish people could be trusted to give them their distance and respect them. They are definitely cute creatures but I didnt enjoy seeing them like that. Again, I wish I had spent a good couple of hours here instead of just stop and see. I can't tell you how's the swimming or the water and I wish I could.

Day 3,

This day was interesting because I didn't plan anything. The only thing I wanted to make sure we did on our trip was the helicopter ride so from some bad advice on this sub, I left my schedule open. I knew that I wanted to do some sort of boat activity and after the helicopter ride I really wanted to do a raft cave tour but (see my rant below...) there were no open bookings! Not for that day or for any other day I was going to be in the island. I checked every single one of them and I happened to find room for two on Captain Andy's Na Pali Raft Day Expedition, only option! I'm actually grateful that it turned out this way because if I had booked my choice I would've gone for a shorter just caves tour and I would've missed out big time!

* I'm going to vent for a bit and hope that you learn from my mistakes. Book everything and anything that you're interested as soon as you can. Also, be prepared for your booking to be cancelled and not rebooked. I left my schedule open in case my helicopter ride was cancelled. See the thing is, the chances of it being rebooked were extremely rare (I didn't know this then). For it to be rebooked, it meant that someone else had to have cancelled. Bookings are pretty much full by the time your vacation comes around and it's rare that there's openings to do the things you want to do when you want to do them, that is IF WHEATHER PERMITS. Every activity in Kauai is dependent on weather so they all could be cancelled. Anyway...

We had breakfast at Gina's Anykine Grinds Cafe, went on the raft tour and relaxed at hotel.

* Gina's. Moco Loco was good. One order was even too much food for the both of us. Highly recommend their pumpkin pie!!
* Captain Andy's Na Pali Raft Day. I absolutely enjoyed seeing all the caves and beaches a bit closer after having seeing them by air. The ride definitely feels long. LOOOOOOOONG. On the way out we did see dolphins so that was pretty neat. I can't say that the beach and snorkeling is super amazing but the experience itself is, it really does give you the ""local"" feel and that's what I enjoyed about it. We saw turtles here and that was the experience I expected vs what I saw on Poipu. Major kudos for our guide, she is a local and she was very respectful of the island and the turtles compared to the other guide with the other group were were with. We were provided lunch and surprisingly this was my favorite meal of our trip! Delicious!

Day 4,

* Mountain Float Tubing. This was the other booking I had. Do recommend!

Day 5,

North side day! This is the only day I woke my husband up early. Left the hotel while it was still dark, stopped by McDonalds for coffee and pies(!). Watched the sunrise at Lydgate park beach. Drove (mostly) all the way to the north side. Started at Ha'ena Beach Park. Explored the cave and walked around Tunnels Beach.

* I don't know how crowded this gets but it was REALLY nice to be here this early. We were the only ones when we got there. The beach here is so beautiful. Again, another great place to see up close after seeing it by air.

Next stop was Hanalei Bay. I kind of messed up a bit here and didn't find the actual parking lot so we parked not by the pier. We parked somewhere a bit north of there and it felt a bit sketchy. This was probably the only place where our car didn't feel safe. This was a very nice walk to the pier. The water here looked so good and I sooo wanted to go swimming but it was too cold. There were a couple of teenagers in but they just assured us that it was not a good idea lol. I dont have much to say about this. Wish the weather had been different.

* Ate at Wake Up Delicious. Food was good.
* Driving through the bridges: There was no traffic at all on the way north as it was too early so we didn't have any issues. On the way back, I don't know if he did it on purpose, but some nice motorcyclist passed us and showed us the way which made it not scary at all.
* Weather: So different in the north side!

Stopped by Kilauea Lighthouse. This was a cute stop. Parking wasn't too bad.

Wailua Falls. This drive  was very familiar as we had drove the same roads the day before with the tubing company. I'm going to be a bit controversial on this but I felt this stop was over rated. The view is not great. Getting in and out is tricky. Parking is tricky. It was a bit too crowded for my liking.

Day 6,

Had breakfast at Tip Top Motel. Food was good. If you remember my rant from before, the following was the only thing I managed to book for this day.

* Kauai Plantation Railway Train & Lunch. This turned out to be a nice slow pace activity for our last day. Who would've thought that I had to travel to an island and spend $200 to eat the most delicious oranges that come from the city I live in. Yeah, eating the fruit here was so fun. Get your money's worth! Take some back to the hotel (and eat it before you leave.) Mosquitos, this was the only place we encountered them. We weren't affected as we were prepared but others in the group had a lot of exposed skin and didnt use bug spray. Guide is well prepared though and had bug spray with him. Lunch was good. Animals were super cute. I highly recommend this tour. It's mellow and the fruit is as fresh as it gets!

Day 7,

Time to go home. Also upgraded our seats for the way back. They do make a difference.

Car Rental review

* Main thing to note about Budget and the rental car: It's Budget!! Align your expectations. Service was fine but it's not 5 star type of service. This other person came back twice complaining about their car being dirty, not sure of any other details or the resolve. For a budget option, this worked out with no issues for me. Our car's windshield was smudgy on the inside but honestly, after we returned our car I understand why some cars might not be as clean as you expect them to be. We're pretty good about cleaning up after ourselves but you're in an island! The amount of mud, sand, wet, and items that get brought in the car is quite surprising. Our car was a mess (imo) when we turned it in and it wasn't an issue.
* Hotel review:
   * Loved the room! We got ""the best view in the hotel"" as it was told by us by front desk and she wasn't lying.
   * I loved opening the balcony doors when I woke up and hearing the birds chirp (very specifically before there were any human noises). This might not be for everyone but I loved it. Also loved heading down to the beach to walk and see the sunrise every morning. Loved, loved, loved!
   * The view from the balcony is incredible but honestly, spending time there wasn't the most calm experience as the pool is right there and there's cleaning maintenance every morning. Pool is a nice visual but there's a lot of noise from the pool and the restaurant. (It's fine, just not calming). Also the noise from the leave blowers EVERY MORNING was awful, hated that part.
   * Hubby is not a beach type of person so it was awesome that he could stay in the room and I could easily walk down and enjoy swimming and sunbathing without dragging him with me.
   * Laundry was a bit challenging. The first laundry room I found had a dryer broken and change machine wasn't working. Change machine also only took $1s and $5s. Second room I found was busy. Found a third room that was bigger, 3 washers, 3 dryers, and TV, compared to just one machine each on the other rooms. But this room dispenser was out of soap and dryer sheets. I had to be walking back and forth so much between 3 floors and our room and the laundry rooms. It was quite the experience. I was happy that there was laundry available because it made packing easier! Having the extra room in our suit cases was awesome to do more shopping in the island.
   * Room service is very disappointing. Should be called food delivery from the restaurant because it's literally that.
   * If I didn't list a restaurant it's because we ate at Kukui's on Kalapaki Beach (restaurant in the Royal Sonesta Hotel.) We ate here too many times out of convenience. Food is not bad but there's better and cheaper options. Wish we had gone to Duke's the first night instead of here.
   * Duke's. I've read a lot about not being able to get reservations but we had dinner here a few times and we didn't have to wait. Delicious food!

A couple of controversial points:

* Food. I'm a foodie and I know a lot of people are big on including places to eat on their itineraries but I didn't think anything I ate was worth going out of the way for. There were a couple of more places we ate at that I forgot about but they weren't memorable. I did have poke, malasadas, and shaved ice. I think the most memorable was the deep fried apple pie at McDonalds because it was the only thing I can't get in the mainland.
* Cost. Kauai didn't feel expensive. It actually felt like I was getting a 5% discount (the tax is so low!) I probably shopped a bit more than I should've at Target and Walmart because it was so CHEAP (Yes, the forbidden word in this sub.) The food portions are HUGE. We always got one meal and shared and it was enough food. I'm not rich or anywhere close. California is equally expensive. San Diego is WAY WAY more expensive.

Overall, Kauai is such a relaxing and beautiful place. It's so difficult to leave!! We did truly embraced island time and it was nice to take it easy. I think that's what I really appreciated about our hotel. It was so simple to get food or enjoy the beach.",VisitingHawaii

With my tax refund estimating around $2000 and my grad school term ending in mid-March, I've decided it's go time. I am willing to put down a bit more, around $500. I am thinking about going around either 3/10-3/15 or 3/17-3/22. This will be a solo-travel

So for $2500, I'm wondering if it's too much/little for all of the following:

* Hotel (no need to be luxury)
   * Maybe Airbnb or hostel if it'll help me save?
* Plane
* Surfing lesson
* Historical site visits
* Dance shows
* Snorkling
* Skydiving/Paragliding
* Hiking
* Nature tours (Volcanoes, waterfalls, forests, etc)
* Off-road driving
* ~~Fine-dining/drinking~~
   * No fancy food necessary. Regular dining/drinks is enough

I want to be clear and say I don't expect to do all of these things in 6 days, I am willing to drop some of these if six days aren't enough

But there are tons of stuff I haven't figured out yet; Which island should I go to do all this, and do I need to visit multiple islands if visiting one isn't enough?

As I recall, the feeling was that the bite was vertical to my toe.

My wife and I really want to see VNP, even if it won't be that fun for the toddler, but as far as other things to do and places to stay there's a lot to choose from. My inclination is to just stay Hilo side so we can avoid driving too much, but I'm not necessarily adverse to being in the car for a couple hours (especially if it's nap time for the kiddo) to get to Waimea or Kona side. We're gonna limit the trip to one overnight, so we can fly out of HNL in the morning and return at any point the following day. 

My wife and I will get kama ªaina rates for lodging, and my brother who is stationed here might also tag along, so we would have access to military facilities as well. Just looking for starting places of how to make the most of our time over there. ",VisitingHawaii

Our Hotel is in Honolulu and we won‚Äôt have a rental car as we‚Äôre planning on using The Bus for most of our traveling.

Our current itinerary is:

Day 1: Arrive at the hotel at 5pm, unpack, take it easy, walk along a beach in Waikiki.

Day 2: Take The Bus in the morning to the Pearl Harbor Visitor Center and see the museums and the USS Arizona. Get some really good food somewhere.

Day 3: Go on a Whale Watching Tour at noon. Then we‚Äôre planning to go to some great shopping/souvenir areas.

Day 4: Spend the whole day at the beach! We‚Äôve heard North Shore is worth it, but we‚Äôre open to any suggestions!

Day 5: Dole Plantation and maybe a hike afterwards?

1706664863.0,Just got back from Kauai (Princeville) recap,"I had a few requests for a follow up of what I did on my trip to Princeville for the past 8 days so here it is- maybe it will help someone (u/mroncnp)! We stayed at the Westin Princeville and had my in laws, husband and 5.5 year old with us. 

Anini Beach- thank you to u/Sailor_Callisto for this great tip. This beach was perfect. Snorkeling, relaxing, no waves (they break way out where the reef begins). The trick here is to keep driving past the main parking area and campground basically all the way to the end of the road- way less people out there and so serene!!! Perfect for kids too since it is shallow and no waves. If you‚Äôre staying at the Westin there is a public path just outside the property but be aware it is steep and can be muddy. 

Hanalei- we LOVED this town. On our first day we went to Hanalei Bread Co for coffee and got my daughter a sandwich, it was all incredible but it does get busy so just be aware you might have to wait a bit for your food if you go. We bought a bag of their 100% Kona coffee and drank it all week‚Ä¶probably the best coffee I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs pricey but worth it. We also had Hanalei Poke Co, AMAZING. I ate there twice. It‚Äôs in the Ching Young shopping center along with lots of fun local shops and food. Also ate Jojo‚Äôs shave ice here as well as Wishing Well Shave ice later in the week. Wishing Well has a coffee shop too and the neatest little sitting area and a couple of shops; wish we would have found it earlier in the week so we could have hung out there more. 

Tunnels Beach- we drove out here and it was a super fun place to stop and watch the surfers. There‚Äôs a cave on the side of the road across from the beach you can wander into and a street side waterfall. Plus the drive out there is amazing as well. 

Luau at Tahiti Nui- we opted for this family run luau that they have once or twice a week. It takes place right next door to the Tahiti Hui restaurant in Hanalei. It was super fun, definitely had a more Thanksgiving at the family table atmosphere but the food was delicious and my daughter loved it. Just be aware that the food line does move kind of slow but we had fun chatting with the people seated around us. 

Blue Hawaiian Helicopters- we took this helicopter tour because they now go out of the tiny Princeville airport. It was INCREDIBLE. Truly an amazing way to see the island. One of the most amazing things I‚Äôve ever done. I would say skip the video though and just take your own. We got it but I wasn‚Äôt as impressed as I thought I would be. 

We did drive all the way out to Waimea Canyon but unfortunately it was completely clouded over inside the canyon and we couldn‚Äôt see anything (luckily we got a do over on our helicopter day). On our way back though we stopped through the town of Hanapepe (Lilo and Stitch‚Äôs home hehe) because I wanted to visit Talk Story, an independent bookstore. If you‚Äôre an indie bookstore lover like me it‚Äôs definitely worth the stop and the owners are so sweet. There is also a swinging bridge here that was fun to cross. 

My daughter (and us) are cat lovers and at Talk Story we saw a flyer for Kauai‚Äôs cat cafe called Tropicats. You can go and play with the cats and even adopt if you want (yes even vacationers‚Ä¶we almost left with one lol) It was in a neat shopping area in Lihue. We went across the street to a place called Noka Grill and I had the best fish and chips and my husband had the loco moco that was excellent. 

The Na Aina Kai children‚Äôs garden play time was a HUGE hit- thanks u/Beautiful_Smile for that recommendation. Check their website for the days they have it and definitely go if you have kids. 

We did go to Opakapaka and it was lovely! The views were so pretty and you can go right outside the back of the restaurant and walk on their beach area. At sunset it was gorgeous and truly we had the best Ahi Nachos there of our lives. 

All of the one lane bridges are so fun and we never had any trouble getting across any of them. The main one is under construction but they only close it at night Monday thru Thursday like 11:30-5:30 so we never ran into an issue. 

The Princeville farmer‚Äôs market on Saturday was fabulous. Really cool vendors and lots of fresh fruits and foods. The Princeville Center has a place called Sandwich Isle that was so delicious and great for a quick bite. The other place we ate at there was Foodland for pok√© haha. One place we hit multiple times there was the Magic Dragon Toy and Art Supply store. Super cute place with fun activities and books if your kids (or you) need something to do. And yes Lappert‚Äôs ice cream next door is SO GOOD- the mint chip is one of the best ice creams I‚Äôve ever had. 

Kilauea Lighthouse was absolutely a beautiful lookout point, so much to see from there. We stopped at a little village shopping area near it and had delicious pizza at a bakery. 

Overall, the vibe on Kauai is SO CHILL. It all feels so much more local and down to earth and we absolutely loved that. There is not a lack of things to do by any means, there were things we didn‚Äôt even get to that we wanted to do. Everything just moves a little slower and we were not mad about that! It was so relaxing and I wanted to cry when we left (my daughter did literally for half an hour after we got to the airport saying how much she didn‚Äôt want to leave). I think that‚Äôs most of it, let me know if you have any more questions about what we did!",VisitingHawaii

1706682123.0,looking for Advice on Hikes to prioritize (Maui/BI),"Going to BI and Maui for first two weeks of Feb (aka starting next week) and looking for last second opinions on whether any of these hikes/outdoor activities are redundant and whether we should prioritize any over the others. As much as I would love to hit all these places I wanna be realistic and sort of identify the ""really want to do's"" vs the ""would be nice if it works out"" in case we decide we need to bail and just take it easy. Oh and for context - we're 2 adults, moderate hikers and no kids.

Currently looking at:

on BI:

* a few small sections of the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail on the west side of the island
* various hikes in the main part of Volcano near the caldera (schedule unfortunately doesn't work out for the Kahuku unit)
* Stargazing tour to Mauna Loa
* south point sunrise + green sand beach hike + Punalu ªu black sand beach
* Hawai‚Äòi Tropical Bioreserve & Garden in PƒÅpa ªikou
* Lili‚Äòuokalani Gardens
* 'Akaka Falls
* Polol≈´ Valley Trail
* Possibly some stuff on the Kohala coast but going to play it by ear

On Maui:

* camping in Hosmer (2 nights) and doing the various shorter trails and \*part\* of Sliding Sands (I'm thinking maybe 2-3 mi round trip) (prob a sunrise and/or sunset)
* camping in Kƒ´pahulu and planning on doing Pƒ´pƒ´wai /Waimoku Falls (early start before parking lot opens to others)
* some part of Wai ªƒÅnapanapa State Park coastal trails - would prob be mid day-ish on a Sat main concern is crowds and timing
* Ke'anae Arboretum and peninsula
* Twin Falls later in day but fine with noping out on this if it's packed
*  ªƒ™ao Valley
* Waihe'e Ridge
* Olowalu Petroglyphs
* NƒÅkƒÅlele Blowhole if the timing works

(These are just snippets of our schedule, I know we need rez's for entry to Wai ªƒÅnapanapa and  ªƒ™ao, and all of these are pending weather conditions.)

The main ones that I'm trying to weigh whether we should go out of our way to absolutely do are Wai ªƒÅnapanapa, Waihe'e Ridge, and 'Akaka Falls. Given the rest of the hikes we're hoping to do, do those any these offer vastly different experiences/environments that we should try to prioritize?

Hello! I am traveling to Waikiki between late May and early June need some guidance on which hotel to stay at. I‚Äôve been doing my research, perhaps to much and seems like all hotels have their cons.

- Good oceanfront view 
- direct beach access 
- decently maintained/clean room
- good breakfast  
- don‚Äôt want to go over budget

1706465027.0,Help Me Choose: BI or Oahu Elopement,"Hi Everyone,

My fianc√© and I are in the process of planning a 6-night elopement in Hawaii in May, and we could use some advice on choosing between Oahu and Big Island. We are on a budget and are factoring in costs related to vendors and accommodations. For context, as a couple, we like beaches, snorkeling, and hiking. We‚Äôve been to Maui and Kauai and loved Hanalei on the north shore of Kauai. Here are our proposed itineraries:

Oahu Itinerary:

* Day 1: Arrive in the afternoon, relax in Waikiki, and settle into our hotel
* Day 2: Morning elopement ceremony with Weddings of Hawaii in a private garden.
* Day 3: Snorkeling at Hanauma Bay in the morning, afternoon hike or surf session
* Day 4: Change hotels, move to Paradise Bay in Kaneohe, and find a scenic hike on the way from Waikiki to Kaneohe
* Day 5: North Shore road trip
* Day 6: Explore the Sandbar at Kaneohe and visit Kualoa in the afternoon
* Day 7: Depart in the morning

Big Island Itinerary:

* Day 1: Arrive in Kona and settle in
* Day 2: Explore Two Step/Manta Ray night snorkel
* Day 3: Hapuna Beach and Waikoloa
* Day 4: Leave Kona and drive to Hilo, stopping at Volcanoes National Park along the way
* Day 5: Have an adventure elopement with a local photographer, no private venue 
* Day 6: Hamakua Coast, including Akaka Falls State Park and Waipi'o Valley
* Day 7: Depart from Hilo

Here are our concerns with each option:

Oahu:

* Worries that the island may feel too congested, with too much city life and traffic
* Concerns that the elopement with Weddings of Hawaii might feel like a cookie-cutter package
* Questions about Paradise Bay's remoteness and its distance from Haleiwa or the North Shore

Big Island:

* Worries about the lack of privacy for the elopement ceremony
* Concerns about the size of the island and the amount of driving required
* Questions about the amount of rain in Hilo

We would greatly appreciate any insights and advice on which option to choose. Additionally, if you have any recommendations for alternative itineraries or elopement advice, please feel free to share. Mahalo!",VisitingHawaii

1706339365.0,Tips for toddlers on Kauai,"Here‚Äôs some tips we have of the more non-obvious from a month in Kauai with a toddler and baby: 

1. You can pay $10 to get a 3-month library card and take out lots of great books (and audiobooks online) or $25 for 5 years.  The Koloa library is located at the elementary school and quite adorable.  Pay in cash for card.  Go with the 5 year as you can access their entire online which includes these awesome scholastic interactive books and more.  Residents are free.  

2. There is a cute outdoor kid‚Äôs play center in the open air mall that‚Äôs near Target (beside it in front of the DejaVu store) that‚Äôs amazing for little kids.  Covered and breezy.  

3. Best Beaches- Anini, Lydgate, Baby and Lumahai river (only in safe condition days) 

4. The Fresh Shave in Koloa is amazing and the owner puts out kid‚Äôs toys so they can play in the little courtyard.  He will also give them snowballs to play with 

5. Early morning beach play is very fun before the sun is high and strong.  

6. Kauai Juice Co has a nut based protein (Island protein) drink and other juices to keep them nice and healthy and full!  

7. Keoki‚Äôs Paradise in Poipu is a fun (Disney like) restaurant for kids.  We went for my niece‚Äôs 11th birthday and her and my almost 3 year old both loved it.  Get the kids drinks in pineapples 

8.  Culinary Market in the shops in Poipu near the Longs on Wednesdays from 3:30-6 is amazing.  Lots of live music, food and produce.  There‚Äôs the most amazing fresh white pineapple juice and frozen pineapple sticks and just beside that vendor a table that sells dairy free muffins that are excellent.  And if you‚Äôre lucky, living foods will have $5 Bao‚Äôs which IMO are the best deal on the island and so incredibly tasty.  Fun for adults and kids.  We went every week.  

9. For an easy kid friendly snack in north, Cafe Turmeric sells naan with hummus and sprouts for $5. Wake up delicious has $1.50 hard boiled eggs that are a great kid‚Äôs snack and they also sell the most amazing macadamia nut cold brew drink for the adults.  Best I had on the island.  

10. Koloa Pizza Kitchen has incredible pizzas and you can order for pickup.  

11. One of our favourite spots on the entire island is the Koke‚Äôe Lodge up on Waimea Canyon.  Food is exceptional.  My husband said it was the best cornbread he‚Äôs ever had.  All of our lunches were fantastic. Board games in lodge.  Kids can spend endless time feeding the chickens and birds outside (they sell feed for $2).  We met other nice families and just had an amazing time.  Was extremely surprised and super happy.  

12. Anaina Hou Community Park is incredible!!!! Do not miss.  Huge play structures for kids.  Incredible.  And there‚Äôs a mini golf place right there too.  

13. There‚Äôs another play structure by Lydgate beach.  I didn‚Äôt like it near as much as Anaina Hou, but another option.  

14. Not much in terms of kid‚Äôs clothing that‚Äôs nice but I found the best at Shipwrecked in Kapaa and Kokonut Kids in Hanalei 

15. Hanapepe is a cute town to walk around.  Good dairy free popsicles in the aloha spice store

16. Costco for everything! 

17. Hoku Market in Koloa for health foods.  Things you‚Äôd get at home and good toddler food items like lentil pasta noodles.  

18.  Lastly, we had an exceptional family photoshoot with a photographer (ashfabhawaii on insta) who was incredibly talented and I highly recommend her.  Photos are so natural and dreamy and she was lovely and professional to work with

We are a family of 5: 2 adults, 3 kids (aged 7, 11, 13). Kids are active and sporty. Our usual vacations are cottage rentals or camping in Ontario, lots of swimming. Kids love swimming in a lake or pool.

We aren't looking for a high-end resort experience. We will rent a car and drive around for hikes, sights, beaches etc. Definitely want to snorkel, surf, explore.

Here are my big questions:

Accommodations: Where to stay? Airbnb/ VRBO house in a place outside of Waikiki? Or some kind of simpler 'resort' with bungalows and a pool? And/or stay in Waikiki for a few nights and then go to somewhere more quiet...? (Follow up: I don't see 'surf lodges' like you hear about in places like Costa Rica -- not a thing here?)

Now I have to figure out how to get him there and do it without spending many thousands of dollars. 
We‚Äôd obviously like to come about 4 days prior to the tournament to enjoy the island and not just sit in the convention center for the 2or3 days of the tournament. 
I‚Äôm thinking of staying 2 nights near the convention center and the other 6 nights can be anywhere else on the island. So 4 nights anywhere, 2 nights near Hawaii convention center, and the last two nights anywhere else again. Unless of course it‚Äôs just better to do all 8 nights in one spot and travel around from a home base.
I‚Äôd like to spend a few nights at least close to a beach, like where I could easily walk to it while lugging beach gear, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs even doable on the island. Or if it is how much that would run me per night. We were just in Puerto Rico in November and got a 2br beachside apartment home for 7 nights for $1400 all in, we were out of our front door and had our toes In the sand within 90 seconds with private beach gate access.

Any good accommodation deals I should look into? Certain beachside hotels, etc? We‚Äôd like a kitchen so we could save money by preparing our own breakfasts and some packed lunches here and there. 

We‚Äôre def more the plate meal type of people. Mom and pop spots and not the sit down fancy spots. What sort of food budget per meal or per day would work with this in mind (for 3 people)?

1706084407.0,Please help with late March Big Island Itinerary,"Hi Folks, have seen great advice given in previous itinerary review posts so I thought I'd solicit thoughts on mine.

We are a couple planning to visit the Big Island for the first time in late March. (Have been to Oahu and Maui before).

We're staying at the Fairmont Orchid for 6 days/5 nights. We enjoy food, water activities and relaxing hikes but open to other suggestions.

Current itinerary as follows:

**Day 1: Arrival**

* Arrive in KOA around noon
* Pick up rental car
* Lunch in Kona - Broke da Mouth Grindz/Da Poke Shack/Pine Tree Cafe
   * Eat at Old Kona Airport State Recreation Area?
* Coffee break at Kona Coffee and Tea
* Supplies/Souvenirs at Costco
* Drive to Fairmont Orchid for check-in
* Dinner: Brown's Beach House

**Day 2:** I will preface this day's plans by saying I understand it's very packed. I'd say this list is aspirational. We are typically flexible and optimize for a leisurely pace and flexibility. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HVNP) day

* Leave hotel for HVNP Area around 8AM
* Pick up eBike rental around 10AM
* Biking/Hiking at HVNP
   * Chain of Craters
   * Check out other cool spots along the way? Any suggestions?
* Lunch - maybe bring lunch, maybe check out Volcano house?
* Drop off Bikes by 4PM
* Check out Hilo?
   * Mochi/Shave Ice/Big Island Candies
* Scenic Drive on the way back with stops at:
   * Rain Falls
   * Akaka Falls
* Dinner: The Fish and the Hog on the way back if time allows?

**Day 3:** Tours in Kealakekua

* Parrots in Paradise Tour
* Lunch: Shaka Tacoz/Black Rock Pizza/Randy's Huli Chicken?
* Greenwell Farms Tour
* Back to hotel to relax
* Dinner: Merriman's

**Day 4:** Relax/Snorkel Day

* Check out snorkel spots and lounge by the pool
* Snorkel spots nearby - feedback welcome:
   * Hapuna Beach
   * Beach 69
   * Ala Kahakai Trail/Pukaho Bay
* **Would appreciate feedback here - is a night Manta Ray tour worth it? I've read incredibly polarizing opinions. If so, this would be the day.**
* Dinner: Open

**Day 5: TBD**

* This is where I'd slot in a potentially a snorkel tour or back to Kealakekua to check out Two Step if we don't choose to do a Manta Ray Tour
* If snorkel tour:
   * Would you recommend a Zodiac boat or big boat?
   * Regardless of vessel, we'd target a tour to Kealakekua Bay - is this the right choice?
* If self-guided:
   * Two step a good enough reason to double back to Kealakekua?

**Day 6: Departure day**

* Be sad we are leaving paradise

**Other Thoughts**

* We usually do a snorkel tour every time we visit Hawaii. We really enjoy it, but feel like we are missing out on other activities. Anything else a ""must-do""? We've seen some ATV + private waterfall tours, ziplining, etc.
* Any suggestions for farmers markets to slot in on any of the days?
* I know we don't have Mauna Kea on here.. should we make that a Day 5 thing?

This will be her first time visiting, and my first time since I was a kid. We‚Äôre in our early 20s and we booked our flight/hotel several months ago. I have not yet booked anything else other than the rental car.

I did a lot of research using this subreddit and Webrender‚Äôs Oahu guide, and I want to say thanks for the vast amount of resources available on this sub. I‚Äôm looking for any feedback on this rough itinerary and anything to look out for, anything specific to do, etc.

(I use times just to gauge driving distances, ensuring we have enough time to get places not being a rush)

\----

**Thu - Day 1, Arrival**

**11:00am:** Arrive at HNL, uber to hotel and check baggage (check-in at 3pm)

**Lunch:** at Iyasume Musubi (or any nearby sit-down place that grabs our attention)

**Rest of Day:** Walk around Waikiki, check in at hotel whenever

* Waikiki Shopping Plaza
* Beach Walk
* Don Quijote
* Ala Moana Shopping Center (Pink Trolley)
* The beach itself (though after check-in since we need change of clothing)

**Dinner:** again will probably just feel out the restaurants around us

\----

**Fri - Day 2**

\~**8-9am: Pick up car rental at Hertz in Waikiki**

* I‚Äôve been warned the Hertz car rental in Waikiki can be very slow - I aim to be there at 8am and account for an hour-long wait
* I‚Äôm <25yo so Hertz through AAA is the only car rental agency that waives young renter fee AFAIK. I also have Hui as a backup in case the rental falls through (though it might cost 2-3x the price of the Hertz rental)

\****if we have to time to kill / car rental is actually quick:*** **Byodo-In Temple**

**Until \~10:45am:** Waimanalo Beach

* 1st beach stop of the day, chill. Will probably pack some small eats ie musubi

**11:20am:** Kualoa Grown Tour

\****optional:*** Kawela Bay Beach Park before lunch, would love a chance to observe sea turtles. Would maybskip Waimea Bay if we do this.

**1:30pm:** Lunch at Ted's Bakery 

* We were interested in the garlic shrimp trucks ‚Äî however seems that lines can be extremely long. I imagine there isn‚Äôt any truly superior garlic shrimp and personally love loco moco, BBQ plates, and would enjoy the variety here + pies

**2:30pm:** Waimea Bay

* 2nd beach stop of the day, wind down before Luau

**4pm:** Waimea Valley, Waimea Falls

**5-8pm:** Toa Lua

\----

**Sat - Day 3**

**8:00am:** Diamond Head Crater Hike

**11am:** Bishop Museum

**12:30pm:** Aloha Stadium Swap & Meet

* Probably grab lunch at a food truck

**By 3:30pm:** Return rental car in Waikiki

**Evening:** leaving this pretty open to do whatever we like in Waikiki. Dinner somewhere nearby as well

\----

**Sun (Birthday!) - Day 4**

\*Per GF‚Äôs request, leaving this day pretty open minus a few bookings! Undecided on breakfast/lunch

**9am:** Surf lessons - Ohana Surf Project

**12pm:** Couple‚Äôs Massage - Lana Kohala 

**6pm:** Nice dinner - maybe Hula Grill for the fun ambience or a sushi bar

\----

**Day 5 -** Flight‚Äôs at \~12pm so will be departing 10am, sleeping in.

We're hoping to do some light hiking while in Hawaii, as well as snorkel, relax, and eat. We also both are big fans of scenic drives! 

Day 1 - Fly into Kona/Stay in Kona

Day 2- Explore Kona in the morning, drive to VNP / Stay overnight at Volcano House in VNP

Day 3 - Explore VNP / Stay overnight at Volcano House in VNP

Day 4 - Drive back to Kona / open day 

Day 5 - Fly from Kona to Kauai 

Day 6 - 8 - Staying in Kauai around Poipu beach area

Day 9 - Flight Back Home (Most likely a red eye)

1705828650.0,Week in Hilo - Itinerary Advice,"Aloha. My boyfriend and I will be flying into Hilo directly at the end of this month. I'm looking for any itinerary advice, comments, additions, forget-that's, etc, as I need to book tours soon. We will be staying at the Hilton, Grand Naniloa, for 7 nights. This gives us about 5 days on the island. Hilton provides snorkel gear daily, as well as $18 food and beverage credit daily if we need to eat early as they open at 6 am, or we can nightcap here.

To preface - I understand Kona is far more popular, but Hilo was within our budget and that part isn't adjustable. I know it'll be more rainy. We have both been to Oahu and Maui. We've also discussed that we both want to be very active on our trip for various reasons. Our flight is 11 hours in, which gives us an even bigger itch to scratch. We LOVE a good and full itinerary. If I can find room, I would love to see Richardson Beach Park, and Coconut Island, and to go to Turtle Cove, probably rent a stand-up paddle board. If I could condense appropriate things together, making room for a whole other day for more travel in Kona, I'd do it. All advice is much appreciated!

**Day 1 | Wednesday -** Fly in around 9 pm, pick up the rental at the airport, and check into the hotel. Head to Hilo Town Tavern to share some nachos, or just grab a bite at the hotel. Get some sleep.

**Day 2| Thursday -** Breakfast at Pauls Place. Settle in at Kulaniapia Falls, private access. I'll be starting my period this day, so, really just big chillin. It's only rough the first day, and with my luck, it'll be early on our flight day, lol. Hang out here 10-3 pm. Refresh at the hotel and head to Moon and Turtle for dinner. *(Should I add something this first day? Outlook, nice walk, etc?)*

**Day 3 | Friday -** Quick 8 am breakfast at Booch Bar. Punalu'u Bake Shop & Beach. VNP all afternoon. *(Where / should I move Punalu'u to another day? Should I wake up super early to try and get to the volcano early instead?) (Also, so far I know I want to do the 'iki trail and tubes... any other recommendations?)* Dinner at Volcano House. Head back to Hilo.

**Day 4 |Saturday -** Coffee at Paradise Coffee Roasters. Check out the market for travel and hotel snacks, puna chocolate, and pick up order from Two Ladies Kitchen. Try new fruits. Swim at Carlsmith. Refresh at hotel. Drive to Mauna Kea. Leave Mauna Kea around 7 pm *(sunset looks to be around 6?)*. Have 8:30 pm - ish dinner at Pineapples Island Fresh Cuisine in Hilo. Sleep. *(Am I cutting that too close or is it just perfect? I read that the summit isn't long after sunset, so I gauge an hour after to use bathrooms etc, parking lot traffic.)*

**Day 5 |Sunday -** Early breakfast. *Debating a helicopter ride with Safari Helicopters around 10 am. (out of our budget at $615 but man.. sounds amazing)*. Kaumana caves, rainbow falls, pe'epe falls, boiling pots *(What's the best order here?)* Dinner at Seaside Restaurant and Aqua Farm. *(I read on an old itinerary someone hit Punalu'u on the same day as these. Is that doable or no? Maybe without Pe'epe? Ignore if you think I should just keep it on the VNP day)*

**Day 6 |Monday -** Kona day! Get breakfast at Hawaiian Style Cafe in Hilo. Head to Greenwell Farms for a coffee tour. Eat Kanaka Kava *(try the kava.. will this be ok before snorkeling though? lol or should I do it after).* Advice is needed on what to do before the tour... 6 pm Manta Ray Night Snorkel via Anelakai Adventures.  After, eat at Umekes *(good choice?)* Drive back to Hilo.

**Day 7| Tuesday -** Last day. Early breakfast at/near hotel. Horseback ride to Umauma Falls via WHBA. Akaka Falls. Eat lunch at What's Shakin. Tropical Bioreserve and Garden. Refresh at the hotel. Dinner at Cafe Pesto\*. (how much time should I set aside for the tropical garden? anything to add here?)\*

**Day 8 | Wednesday -** Super early flight out.

The rest of the activities are mainly outdoors stuff like swimming, beach, and biking. I am a very adrenaline rush person who loves high thrill activities which would make me think I might enjoy skydiving (either in Oahu or Kauai) more.

1705449045.0,Hotel selection help - Waikiki April 2024,"Aloha! My husband and I are traveling to O'ahu April 9-15 for my 30th birthday and our 1st wedding anniversary and we have been struggling to select a hotel for the trip. I have been reading through other hotel-related posts in this sub as well as Google/TripAdvisor reviews of each hotel and needless to say, we're overwhelmed with information. 

&#x200B;

The main hotels that we have been looking at, but are just unsure of/would like some feedback on are (not in any particular order):

1. Queen Kapi ªolani
2. Hilton Waikiki Beach
3. Hilton Garden Inn
4. DoubleTree by Hilton Alana
5. White Sands
6. Hyatt Place Waikiki  


The key details we're looking for/about us:

* We are trying to book solely using Chase points but are fine shelling out a little bit more in ca$h for the right place (as of now we have 113k in points to use).
* Not interested in the HHV but we don't mind noise from the street/city. Just not excessive noise, please (like a club next door or something).
*  Partial view of the ocean is fine! We just don't want a city only view if we could help it.
*  We'd like to be within a 10 min walk to the beach, prefer to stay in Waikiki proper (our first time to O'ahu). 
* We're big foodies so places that are close to restaurants/food trucks or better yet, have a great in-house restaurant is preferred. 
* We will not have a car (plan to rent one for any day excursions but will not need to pay to park overnight).

Mahalo in advance for all the help and recommendations! ",VisitingHawaii
1705416003.0,Vegan options on Oahu?,"Hi everyone - my wife and I are leaving for our Honeymoon on the 27th and are staying at Turtle Bay on Oahu for 10 days.

My wife is vegan, and she was very excited for a dinner at AV Restaurant in Honolulu. Unfortunately, we just found out that the establishment experienced a fire that is forcing them to shut their doors for at least a month.

Does anyone have some alternative options for a similar dinner experience? AV sounded really cool - they had a 10 course menu that changed all the time and was exclusively vegan.

1705423857.0,Ride services that offer toddler car seats in Waikiki,"Hello!

I‚Äôve been reading up on the sub as well as searching through ride services that offer car seats, so that I don‚Äôt need to bring my own.

It seems like the consensus is to bring 1 from home, but ideally I‚Äôd like to avoid that; they are bulky and we are not planning to travel much in Oahu.

We are a family of 4, with a 6 year old and a 2 year old. Bringing a booster for the older 1 is easy enough, since those are small and light. As for the younger one, I can‚Äôt seem to find anything that is travel friendly, so ideally, I‚Äôd like to use what‚Äôs available when we get to Oahu.

We are not planning to move around much; mostly airport to hotel, hotel to hotel and hotel to airport. We will be there for 10 days so I‚Äôd like to avoid renting a car, to avoid the crazy hotel car parking prices, and for the fact that we won‚Äôt be using it much.

From my own research, these are my options:

- Taxi: May be able to not bring a car seat due to laws not requiring them for taxis, or I need to bring my own.

- Uber: would need to bring my own car seats

- Rental cars: daily rental fee for car seats. We won‚Äôt use the car aside from going to and from airport, and moving hotels once. Also hotel parking is really expensive.

- Turo: seems like some cars offer car seats for a small fee.  But that‚Äôd require me to keep them parked in expensive parking spots at hotels.

- Shuttle services: I‚Äôm unsure on this one, there seems to be many different companies but they don‚Äôt expand on how they handle car seats on their websites. I might need to reach out to them to ask about specifics.

For those of you who traveled with a 2 year 
old, what was your strategy? Any recommendations on portable car seats for 2 year olds, who can‚Äôt use booster seats yet?

1705340277.0,Maui or Kauai?,"My husband and I are thinking of planning a trip to Hawaii this spring, and are just starting to look into the islands. This sub's consensus seems to be that Maui is the best island for Hawaii ""beginners"", and it does have basically everything we're looking for. However, I've also heard great things about Kauai, and it seems to be quieter with slightly more natural beauty than Maui. I also know Maui is still recovering from the wildfires, and I'm not sure how that would affect a vacation there. Here's the things we're looking for the most:

* Beautiful soft sand beaches with warm blue water
* Hiking with amazing views
* Snorkeling
* Stargazing
* Parasailing (maybe, not a must)
* Whale watching (also not a must, I know it's seasonal)
* Restaurants (or food trucks)
* And ideally, as much peace & quiet as possible for the above

I got lots of great insights on here prior to our trip.

Overall, it was a great trip and we will return to Kauai in the future.  I think we did everything we had set out to do for this trip except for hiking the Kalalau trail.  That can wait for our next trip here.  As the weather we faced during the 3 nights in the Princeville area was pretty nasty.  In the future, if we were to return the winter months,  we'll probably stick to the southern shores of Kauai.  We will save the north shore for the summer months.

The other activity that we did not get a chance to do was some fishing.  My wife caught a lingering cough and with the sea swells being so high, she didn't feel comfortable going out deep sea fishing.  

Hotel:

Westin [Princeville](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60626-Princeville_Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html): 3 nights (Dec 20-23)

\- Good location to use as base to explore the north shore

\- 1 Bedroom villa, nice to have a full size kitchen

\- Since it‚Äôs consider a vacation/timeshare property, no Marriott Bonvoy Titanium benefits like free breakfast

\- Excellent Bonvoy breakfast benefit ‚Äì 3-4 selections per day

\- Nice location on the beach, not too crowded with loungers easy to find

\- Watch out for the seals that come up to the beach

\- Friendly staff and great service

\- Good location to use as base to explore the West/East/South side of the island

[Car Rental](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii.html) u/Hertz: Had a great corporate rate for $290 tax included for the 8 days. [Car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii.html) was ready when we got to the rental area. No issues here.

Restaurants:

Aina ‚Äì Enjoyed the unique Japanese Omakase using local ingredients. Didn‚Äôt like the prepaid requirement, but overall one of the better meals we had in Kauai. Highly recommend.

[Bar Acuda](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60612-d633415-Reviews-Bar_Acuda-Hanalei_Kauai_Hawaii.html) ‚Äì We sat outside in the lanai, which was very nice and charming, if we were seated inside, it might‚Äôve been too loud to enjoy dinner and have a conversation without shouting. We ordered 5 tapas dishes for the two of us, and left very full. Everything we ate was unique and delicious, although couple dishes were a bit too salty. The cocktails were very nice. One of the better meals we had in Kauai. Highly recommended.

Rum Fire u/Sheraton ‚Äì We ate here the first night at the Sheraton, after a long day of driving from the North shore to the South with activities in between. We had a great table to watch the sunset. Food was fine, typical hotel restaurant fare. Definitely a great place to have a drink and watch the sunset. The prices were very high, one of the more expensive meals we had in Kauai.

Tables@[Poipu](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60625-Poipu_Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html) ‚Äì I wanted to say we enjoyed our dinner here, and I am sure we did, but overall I don‚Äôt really remember much from it. Lol It wasn‚Äôt good nor bad, just unremarkable from all the other restaurants we tried in Kauai.

Caf√© Portfino ‚Äì We ate dinner here on Christmas day, and I had an intense cravings for pasta, after a week of Fish and steak. This place hit the spot for the pasta. The view from the lanai was spectacular, and can‚Äôt really find fault. If there was one negative, it would be they served every very fast, we were done dinner within one hour, same with other tables around us. Maybe it was due to xmas day and they want to go home? A good change of pace restaurant from all the fish/seafood places.

Oasis On The Beach ‚Äì Average food but what a great spot for the sunset. Lovely place.

The Beach House - I really wanted to give this place a positive review, since the place is absolutely beautiful and perfect spot for the sunset. However, there is just something off with this restaurant for me. Starting from front of the house, there are no parking spots at all, if driving, need to use the valet. And if you are there during busy hours, the wait to drop off and pick up are long. Then once inside, the noise level is very noticeable. Very hard to have a conversation in the dining room, almost need to shout at each other, and that adds to the noise level. Then to the food, which was just average fare, that can be found at any restaurant, nothing creative with the items.

Activities:

Haena State Park/Ke‚Äôe Beach/[Kalalau Trail](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29218-d102945-Reviews-Kalalau_Trail-Kauai_Hawaii.html): The 3 days that we were staying in the North Shore, the weather was terrible. So bad that on the first day, there were flooding and they closed off the [Hanalei](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60612-Hanalei_Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html) bridge. They cancelled the Shuttle bus for the day that we had reserved and closed off the Kalalau trail. We were able to drive up to the park and walked to the Ke‚Äôe beach on another day. Didn‚Äôt spend too much time at Ke‚Äôe beach as it was raining and skies were dark. Didn‚Äôt get to hike the trail.

[Hanalei Bay](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29218-d647555-Reviews-Hanalei_Bay-Kauai_Hawaii.html)/[Anini Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29218-d207416-Reviews-Anini_Beach-Kauai_Hawaii.html)/Kilauea Lighthouse: Drove by this on our way to the south. Nice quick diversions.

Jack Harter Doors Off helicopter: We reserved the 2pm ride during our drive down to Poipu. By far this was our favourite activity while in Kauai. The views of the different climates and mountain ranges and the Na‚ÄôPali coast were breathtaking. We are still talking about it. It was quite windy and some rain during our ride, so some areas there were definitely strong turbulence, and with the doors off, made for some ‚Äòexciting‚Äô moments. I suggest everyone to do this excursion.

Waimea Canyon/[Spouting Horn](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60625-d669719-Reviews-Spouting_Horn-Poipu_Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii.html)/Kauai Coffee: Drove to the end of the Waimea Canyon, unfortunately, on the day of our drive, when we got to the top/end of the trail, it was very foggy and raining, so the views weren‚Äôt as nice as it could‚Äôve been. On the way back to Poipu, we stopped off [the Kauai](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60623-d87340-Reviews-The_Kauai_Inn-Lihue_Kauai_Hawaii.html) Coffee for a self guided tour, and some free coffee samplings. Then went to the Spouting Horn blowhole. With the high tides, the blow hole was very high.

Makauwahi Cave/Maha‚Äôulepu Trail/Opaeka‚Äôa Falls/[Wailua Falls](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60623-d546344-Reviews-Wailua_Falls-Lihue_Kauai_Hawaii.html): In the morning, we hiked the Maha‚Äôulepu trail. This was a nice flat hike/walk and it took about 2 hours round trip to the cave and back. Highly recommended for anyone to do, amazing views of the coast and the hike was very casual. After that we drove to the two falls.

Kiahuna Beach/[Poipu Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60625-d155138-Reviews-Poipu_Beach_Park-Poipu_Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii.html): When I was golfing in the morning, the wife spend time at the beaches and I joined her in the afternoon after finishing my round. The Kiahuna beach was accessed right from the Sheraton and it was perfectly fine. One day we walked from the Sheraton to the Poipu beach in the afternoon to watch the sea turtles and seals return. It took about 20 minutes of slow walking to get there. Way too crowded compared to Kiahuna. Much more enjoyed Kiahuna, but that might also be that it was on our hotel.

Golfing: My wife don‚Äôt golf, so I was playing solo and didn‚Äôt bring my clubs so had to get rentals. I played 4 rounds in the 8 days on Kauai, and all the courses were great to get on as a solo. Three out of the four times I was able to walk on the course as a solo, and the other time I was teamed up with a father and son pair that was great to play with.

Princeville Makai: I played this course twice. What a great course, that hole #6 was incredible. The people working there was so nice. I played on back to back days, the starter and person working the cart area remembered my name and jokes we talked about the previous day.  The course was well maintained. Since the week I was there, it was raining consistently, it was cart path only, which made for some extra walking when playing solo. The green fee‚Äôs were quite high at $295 plus $80 for club rental. But for a once in a lifetime opportunity, it was worth it. The Westin Princeville villa that we were staying at is on the 13th/14th hole, so when I was near those holes, I called my wife, and she was able to come and watch me hit a few holes, and took some pics/videos. That was a plus.

Kiahuna Golf Course: This was really close to the Sheraton Kauai, about a 5 minute drive. Good mountain course, and it‚Äôs harder than it looks lol. I definitely had more trouble here than Makai. Green fees were cheaper than Makai, at $140 and 60 for rental. However, the conditions here weren‚Äôt as well maintained. Lots of burnt areas on the greens, divots weren‚Äôt repaired, tee boxes uneven. If this course was not in Kauai, not sure it would be worth $140, which was too bad, as the course itself and the views were nice.

Poipu Bay: The longest and toughest of the three courses I played. It was an amazing course with great ocean and mountain views. However, I much enjoyed the Makai course more. Maybe it was the people working there, or the other golfers. But I found Makai to be more ‚Äòrelaxing‚Äô while the vibe at Poipu was too ‚Äòbougie‚Äô?

Also, we used Oahu as a stop to the main purpose of our trip which was a 8 night stay in Kauai. 

The weather was pretty crappy during the first stint we were on Oahu, and got much better for the 2nd part.  Couple of activities that I thought I would do but didn't do on Oahu this trip was golfing and fishing.  With golfing, I had golfed 4 times on Kauai, and it wasn't very convenient to drive to the courses from our hotels in Oahu that I didn't felt like it.  Fishing, my wife developed a lingering cough, so didn't want to get on a boat for deep sea fishing, and I didn't feel like going by myself.  Also, i couldn't find a spot to do any shore fishing(i did bring my portable rod),  although i didn't try too hard to find spots.

**Hotels:** Royal Hawaiian for 3 Nights and Hilton Hawaiian Village for 5 nights

\- It was our first time staying at the RH and 3rd time at the HHV. There was definitely an old world charm to the Royal Hawaiian, the location was perfect for Waikiki walking. We booked a lounger set on the beach for the first day at the RH, too bad it was raining pretty much all day. But the service was great and nice to have a quiet beach day after a 10 hour travel from Toronto. We got a nice corp rate of $500 a night for a King room in the Malani tower, so had a great view of the Waikiki beach and Diamond head.

\- The HHV was busy and full of families and kids. We knew what we were getting into, so were ok with the crowds and noise. Being NYE period, we had used Hilton points for this stay, and it was fair price to pay. The only complaint is the crazy pricing for self parking, it was $68 per day, but we were a captive audience so had to pay to play I guess.

**Car Rental:** This was a must for us, as we like to drive around and check out all the spots on the island. Had a great corp rate through Hertz and paid $180 per week for a full size car.

**Restaurants:** I have top tier status with Hilton and Marriott, so we get free breakfast benefits at each of the hotel. So didn‚Äôt eat breakfast outside of the hotel. We tend to have a lighter or skip lunch, as we are still pretty full from breakfast, and would indulge more for dinner. Here are the places we ate at in no particular order:

Michel‚Äôs, Senia, Marugame Udon, Name Kaze, Pig and the Lady, Mud Hen Water, Goofy‚Äôs, HK Dim Sum and Seafood Restaurant, BBQ Joshi, and Halewia Joe‚Äôs Haiku Garden

Our faves were definitely Senia, Pig and the Lady, and Mud Hen Water.  Those hit our preferences for small plates and farm to table style dining. Our least favourite was Name Kaze, mostly for the service. The food itself was fine and we enjoyed it, but we felt very rushed. We got reservations for 8:15pm and they close at 9pm. But when we got there, we were told that we need to put in all our orders by 8:30pm. Again, this was another ‚Äòtapas‚Äô/small plates style restaurant, so it felt rushed to decide all the dishes we want.

Another note, we spend one lunch walking around Chinatown and had dim sum at the HK Dimsum and Seafood restaurant, which is just down the street from Senia/Pig and the Lady. We were glad we went to Chinatown this time, both previous trips, we skipped Chinatown. It was an interesting experience walking around and seeing all the shops. Was some areas a little sketchy? Sure, but at no time did we feel threatened. Would definitely go back, at least during the day. :) And the dimsum at that restaurant was very good and authentic. Definitely better than what they serve at Tim Ho Wan.

NYE: We also went to the Halekulani‚Äôs Ballroom countdown party. This was an interesting experience if nothing else. We had gone in not knowing that this event was targeted towards a specific clientele(Japanese). I would say about 80% of the customers were Japanese. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but it made for very awkward moments during the evenings. As we were placed in a round tables of 10, most of the guests sitting at our table didn‚Äôt speak English well. So there weren‚Äôt many opportunities for conversations or socializing with other people. The other negative was that there weren‚Äôt a ‚Äòparty‚Äô atmosphere, no dancing. The main focus was the buffet dinner, which was great and had lots of selections. Then watch a cover band play, without a dance floor, then we were ushered to the hotel‚Äôs patio to wait and watch the countdown and the fireworks.

This was stark difference to the party that was happening at the House without a Keys‚Äô garden NYE party, they had a band going after dinner and a nice dance floor while waiting for the fireworks. The crazy thing was, we paid more for the ballroom party than the House without a Keys party. Should‚Äôve just went to that party. As it turned out, after the fireworks were finished, the wife and I crashed downstairs to their dance floor. Lol

Activities:

**Pearl Habour/Might MO**: We had been to Pearl Harbour during our prior visits, however, we didn‚Äôt get the chance to tour USS Missouri. So this trip, I booked the Captain‚Äôs tour of the Missouri. Driving there and doing the tour was easy and a must do for any tourist. The captain‚Äôs tour was well worth it, seeing the inside was eye opening. Especially, the missile launchers.

**North Shore/Waimea Valley-Falls/Haleiwa Town:** We spend a day driving up to the north shore. Started the day by driving to Waimea Valley and walking through to Waimea Falls. I didn‚Äôt think Waimea Falls was worth the admission or the time spent. Maybe we had seen too many beautiful water falls already in Kauai the prior week, but the Waimea Falls was not too impressive. Also, hint, if you have to park in the overflow parking lot, make sure you don‚Äôt park under those red/blue berry trees. Those berries were dropping big time, and they stain all the cars(including ours) around that area pretty bad.

After Waimea, we drove along to Haleiwa town, we stopped off at couple of beaches along the way, forgot what they were called, but the surfs were amazing, and we just watched the surfers for a bit.

We walked around Haleiwa for a bit, and had Ray‚Äôs BBQ/roasted chicken for lunch, they were great. We had shaved ice from Aoki‚Äôs. we didn‚Äôt want to wait in the insane line across the street.

**Ho‚Äôomaluhia Garden/Byodo-In temple/Makapu‚Äôu Point Lighthouse/Halona Blowhole/Pali Lookout:** We spent a day driving around the East/south side of Oahu and visited these sites. All of them were pretty interesting. Would definitely go back to Ho‚Äôomaluhia Botanical garden and spent more time walking around the different areas.

Rest of the time was spent relaxing by the beach or the hotel pools.",VisitingHawaii

1704273091.0,Wave Safety,"When people say that the waves/beaches in Hawaii are different, please don‚Äôt take their advice lightly. The beaches I‚Äôve been to in the US and around the world are nice to swim in unless the conditions are very extreme, but in Hawaii, Kauai in particular because thats where I visited, the waves may seem safe and manageable but they are definitely not. Especially during the winter months on the West/North side of Kauai. 

When I turned my back to the waves because I was taking a quick look towards the beach, the waves nearly broke my neck. The water rushing back into the ocean swept my feet from under me and the wave crashing over me sent my face straight into the sand and rolled my entire body over my neck. In the moment, I thought I had broken my neck and paralyzed myself. This happened in knee to waist deep water which seems to be the most dangerous spot on a beach. Thankfully, I was able to walk away with a hyperextended/strained neck and a newfound respect for the ocean. This happened at Kekaha beach, an amazing spot for surfing/boogie boarding, just ensure you take proper wave safety precautions before swimming.

We also tried to stretch our budget to stay longer in each island, which meant we chose cheaper options for lodging and rental cars, while trying to enjoy the best food and activities at low costs. All flights were booked with travel points and the residual costs are not included.

# Cost Summary 

|Category / Island|Maui|Hawai'i (Big Island)|O'ahu|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Lodging|$1,512|$550|$991|
|Rental Car|$184|$442|$149|
|Food|$607|$254|$496|
|Activities|$683|$331|$1,006|
|Total|$2,986|$1,577|$2,642|

All costs are for 2 people and all values are rounded for simplicity.

# Maui [7 days]

We started our trip in Maui and stayed in an Airbnb in Kihei, near Charley Young Beach. The location was great as it was close to nearly everything we visited.

* ***Rental Car*** \- Kihei Rent-a-Car
   * We have rented from them twice, and they are very quick to pick us up and get us on the road! The car we rented was an older model Nissan Sentra, which was perfect for what we needed. No frills, but clean and feels well-serviced. We were able to drive to see sunrise on HaleakalƒÅ with the car. No complaints!
* ***Food Recommendations***
   * Island Vintage Coffee - Amazing coffees (banana kona mocha is our favorite), acai bowls, and shave ice!
   * Thai Mee Up - Food truck in the lot near Costco. Best Thai food we've had, ever! 
   * Paia Fish Market - Any location is great. Can get crowded at meal times, but is well worth the wait.
   * Foodland Poke - Fresh, well-priced, with lots of difference choices.
* ***Activities*** \[!!!\] = Our Highest Recommendation!
   * \[!!!\] Molokini Crater Snorkeling Tour - Amazing place to snorkel! Water temperature surprisingly seemed warmer than when we visited in the summer. We went with Trilogy for the earliest morning slot. It was not very crowded, and the tour was standard. Snacks, drinks, and lunch were provided. Conditions did not allow us to go to Turtle Town, so we diverted to Olowalu, and we did see a green sea turtle there! 
   * O'o Farms Tour - A farm-to-table tour on the slopes of HaleakalƒÅ. We were able to see many different types of plants, many of which were prepared in the dishes served at the end of the tour. The cost was a little pricey, but we were glad we did it.
* ***Low-Cost and Free Activities*** \[!!!\] = Our Highest Recommendation!
   * Sunrise at HaleakalƒÅ - It was cold, rainy, and foggy when we went, but we still enjoyed being at the summit. It started getting crowded around an hour before sunrise, but since it was rainy, most people stayed in their cars. We'll try coming again next time!
   * \[!!!\] Iao Valley - Beautiful and lush valley with a nice trail to walk along. Make sure to make a reservation! 
   * \[!!!\] Waihe'e Ridge Trail - Few things compare to seeing the view from the top for the first time. 
* ***Do-Not-Recommend List***
   * Mama's Fish House - This was our first time visiting, and we were very excited that we were able to reserve a spot for dinner. The area is very beautiful and the presentation of the restaurant is exactly what we expected, but the food itself was not to our liking, especially for the price. Maybe we're more food truck people! We're glad we experienced it, but we would not go again.

# Hawai'i (Big Island) [4 days]

We decided to go to the Big Island between Maui and O'ahu as an afterthought. People kept telling us that 4 days (with 2 of the days including flights) was not enough, and we should have listened! What an amazing and expansive island! We stayed in Airbnb's in Kona and Hilo, and we are already planning on visiting here again.

* ***Rental Car*** \- Big Island Jeep Rental
   * We rented from here since they allowed us to go up to the summit of Mauna Kea in the rental. The prices for Mauna Kea sunset and stargazing tours (for 2 people) would be more expensive than renting a 4x4 and doing it ourselves. They do have a minimum number of days you have to reserve the car for, though. Picking-up and dropping-off the car was easy, and they were very kind and responsive through email, text, and over the phone.
* ***Food Recommendations***
   * Pine Tree Cafe - Large selection of foods at a great price! So delicious, we ate here twice!
   * 808 Grindz Cafe - So much food for so cheap! We wanted to come back here, as well, but they were closed the second time we came around.
   * Nephi's Smokehouse - We usually don't like smoked meats and sausages, but this place is built different! We were comparing a lot of the restaurants we went to afterwards to this place.
   * Two Ladies Kitchen - So many choices of mochi! By the time we arrived in the afternoon, there was a line and a few options were already sold out, but the line moved quickly and we were still able to get a large assortment of flavors. 
* ***Activities*** \[!!!\] = Our Highest Recommendation!
   * \[!!!\] Manta Ray Night Snorkeling - This was by far the best activity we did on any of the islands! We went with Big Island Divers. We are not religious people, but this felt like an spiritual experience. One of us went SCUBA diving, where we sat on sea floor, and the other snorkeled at the surface. We both got great views of everything that happened. Words cannot describe the feeling of a manta ray swimming inches from your face as a monk seal looks on at the manta ray, confused. 
* ***Low-Cost and Free Activities*** \[!!!\] = Our Highest Recommendation!
   * \[!!!\] Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park - So much to do, not enough time! We were fortunate enough to explore the lava tube by ourselves by arriving early in the morning. We recommend the Kilauea Iki Trail!
   * \[!!!\] Mauna Kea Sunset and Stargazing - A very close second for our favorite activity. We arrived about two hours before sunset), but even when it started to become crowded, people were able to spread out across multiple viewing areas. The sunset was beautiful against the contrast of the snow as you are looking from above the clouds. We rushed to head down just as the sun dipped so we could park at the visitor center and stargaze, but we didn't need to as most people didn't stick around. Seeing the Milky Way with our own eyes was breathtaking. 

**O'ahu** \[7 days\]

Our first time in O'ahu! Since we were staying in an Airbnb in Waikiki, we were expecting it to be more urban, but it was a little more overwhelming than we expected. We love spending time outdoors, so while this island was not our cup of tea, we can see how it's a great location for lots of people.

* ***Rental Car*** \- Lucky Owl Car Rental
   * Very similar to Kihei Rent-a-Car. No frills and well-priced. Don't expect a Bentley and you'll be fine!
* ***Food Recommendations*** 
   * Leonard's - We went very early in the morning (right when they opened) and we were served very quickly! Nothing beats a fresh, hot malasada before a hike!
   * Kono's - We passed by this place nearly every day and decided to try it on one of our last days. We wished we tried it sooner! Their bombers (burritos) are so filling and savory. We even had to save half of our own burritos since it was so much food. We went here twice!
   * The Sunrise Shack - We visited the locations in Haleiwa and in Waikiki. Smoothies were good, but the stars of the show were the smoothie bowls. This is exactly what we think of when we think of an acai or smoothie bowl. We talk about the Blue Dream and Monkey Bowls all the time! Exactly what we needed for a warm day watching surfers on the North Shore.
   * Seven Brothers - After you've worked up an appetite from watching surfers from the beach, do yourself a favor and head over to Seven Brothers. After days of seafood, nothing hits better than a burger and home fries. So good!
* ***Activities*** \[!!!\] = Our Highest Recommendation!
   * \[!!!\] Turtle Canyon Snorkeling - Our charter with a different company was canceled last minute, but we were able to book one for the next day with Living Ocean Tours. We left early in the morning, which allowed us to be in the water before many of the other charters. We saw too many green sea turtles to count! The guides did a great job of keeping us a safe distance from the turtles and gave us lots of information throughout the snorkel. 
   * Kualoa Ranch Zipline - Our first experience on a zipline, and we loved it! The tour guides were fun and well-prepared. The drive up from the entrance to the zipline base camp was a mini-tour of some filming locations, which was a nice bonus! 
   * Snorkeling with Sharks - We went with One Ocean Diving after seeing recommendations online. While this was one of the most Jaw(s)-dropping things we've ever done, the experience with the charter a little disappointing. I'm sure every experience varies, but this time, it seemed like the crew cared more about getting their own GoPro videos than making sure we spent time seeing the sharks. We would still recommend it, but only because of how cool and amazing the sharks were. Your mileage may vary!
   * Chief's Luau - We loved our experience with the Old Lahaina Luau, so we wanted to attend one in O'ahu. The price was cheaper than others, and after a quick online search, I saw enough recommendations to decide on this place. The experience felt a little cheap (funnily enough it is in a water park), but the hosts and entertainers were fun. The food was okay, but don't feel bad if you eat a meal before coming here. 
* ***Low-Cost and Free Activities*** \[!!!\] = Our Highest Recommendation!
   * Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve - We were unable to get reservations online, so we tried our luck with arriving in the morning for a walk-in ticket. However, it seemed like every other visiting family had the same idea! There was a large backup on the road leading into the entrance, and once the gates opened at 6:45am, it was a free-for-all getting into the park. We were very lucky to get in and get walk-in tickets. The beach and reefs were beautiful and serene in the morning, but it quickly became crowded as the morning went on. We were one of the first people in the water, and we saw a green sea turtle right away! The reefs are mostly very shallow, with visibility varied as waves rolled in. Compared to snorkeling sites in Maui and Hawai'i (Big Island), we were a little underwhelmed by the conditions. We are glad we visited here, but we would not try our chances with a walk-in ticket again. 
   * Diamond Head - We arrived in the morning just before sunrise and made our way to the top as the sun was rising. It was very crowded at the top, with every inch of railing filled with people viewing the sunrise. Regardless, a great view!
   * \[!!!\] Koko Crater - If you've done the Manitou Incline, this should be a piece of cake! Also, nothing humbles you like a 8-year old sprinting past you as you're taking your tenth break in 5 minutes. Arguably, a better view than Diamond Head (you can see down into Hanauma Bay)!

1704303567.0,Lihue airport to Haena state park,"Aloha,

I will be traveling from Oahu on Friday, 1/5 landing first thing in the morning at 7 am and driving to haena state park to hike the kalalau trail. 

I plan to camp overnight (I have a permit) and hike back out on 1/6, leaving on a flight at 4 PM on 1/6.

I have a couple of questions-

1. Will the road closures affect my travel from Lihue airport to haena state park on 1/5? It sounds like right lane closure from post 0-10 might do so..

https://hidot.hawaii.gov/highways/roadwork/kauai/

2. If not, how long will it take me to drive on 1/6 from haena state park back to Lihue airport? I‚Äôm trying to calculate it so I can wake up early enough to hike out 11 miles and drive back with time to make the flight.

I know it‚Äôs a bit ambitious but having grown up here, it has always been a dream to hike this trail.

Your help would be much appreciated.

1704314441.0,White Lotus Honeymoon on a Budget,"We would love any help in finding the best luxury hotel for our honeymoon (and our budget).

With the different islands and load of resorts available it's hard to choose what would be best for what we're after, which is essentially the 'White Lotus' experience but not forking out for the Four Seasons.

Background is that we'll be flying in April from LAX to Hawaii (destination airport flexible) and flying back 11 days later from Honolulu. To save money we only want to spend 4 nights at the 'luxury' hotel. We'll also stay in an Airbnb (preferably in Maui) for 3 days to explore/do more activities and somewhere in Honolulu for a few nights at the end of the trip. Maui seemed to be island of choice for honeymoons and an 'all-rounder' Hawaii experience so that's what we were focussing on, but could be swayed.

Out budget is \~¬£2,500 GBP ($3,200 USD) for the 4 nights, and we'd like a resort with on-site restaurants, pool-bar, access to beach, preferably not full of kids, a good location for snorkelling.

So far the closest to the vision within budget has been the Hyatt Regency or AC Hotel by Marriott, but it looks like there could be other resorts on other islands for similar/better experience and value.

Any recommendations or expert tips would be amazing!",VisitingHawaii

I have been to airports where I arrived after closing and the rental car shop had a policy of staying open an hour past their closing time, so it worked out. I think I would rather not bet on this happening again, though. I was pretty lucky.

I could pick up the car the next morning, but this adds the additional cost of getting a taxi each way, and means that I wouldn't be able to wake up before sunrise to get an early start on a road trip the next day.

I am also considering renting through Turo or Hui. It seems that Hui is contactless/digital check-in/Pick-up so I could pick it up whenever I want if shit hits the fan with the flight. It seems that Turo offers delivery, but still involves checking in with the host face-to-face, and I have to imagine that none of the hosts want to drop off a car at 12:30 to 1:30 in the morning.

1704151490.0,Trip Report - First trip ever: Oahu/Big Island - Long report,"So this was back at the end of May 2023 and early June 2023. Time got away from me with writing this report. Big thanks to all the frequent commenters that helped along the way to planning this trip. I figured I started thinking about this trip at the beginning of 2023 so finally getting to write this now might help others planning their vacation in 2024 around the same time.

**For reference,** This was a trip with my parents, they're in their early 70s with not much walking stamina so hence no significant hiking happened and a lot of things changed so we could rest more. **Also no rental car... for either island, Uber, tour buses and Kona Trolley** were main modes of transportation**.** My dad's biggest thing to see in Hawaii was Pearl Harbor hence you will see we spent an entire day there. We had fun overall, it was a nice but expensive trip but omg the flight from NYC to Honolulu is ridiculous. West coasters are so lucky to have only a 5 hour flight vs 10 hours.

I'm going to copy over the itinerary I posted prev and post what I happened/changed. It's a VERY long post, so bear with me.... or scroll down to TLDR at end for lessons learned...

**Day 1 - Travel day...** flight arrives at 3pm from NY**.** Check into **Hilton Waikiki Village**.... the lines to check in were nonexistent, significantly shorter than when we checked out. It probably helped we arrived on Memorial day. Asked the front desk for as high as possible for our Ocean Front room in the Rainbow tower, Got Rm 911. It was the most amazing view ever, parts of the beach/trees and view of Diamond head.

**Day 2** \- **Pearl Harbor**  : Got 1:45pm reservations for USS Arizona, I accidentally missed the first day of ticket release by 3 days so no morning times were left. Had McDonald's for their local breakfast platters \~7am.... my parents were very amused about having rice for breakfast and esp at McDonald's. (We are Chinese, so we eat rice all the time but usually not for breakfast lol.)

Got to Pearl harbor by 8ish am. We could see 2 huge lines for USS Arizona from the entrance, bought the Pearl Harbor pass so we caught the bus around 830am  to Ford Island to USS Missouri and Aviation museum. 

**Spent the most time at USS Missouri, at least 90 min, did not do additional tours, but we just happened to run into a tour guide doing the free tour in Mandarin**. She was standing around with a family of Taiwanese tourists waiting to start the tour and asked if we were Chinese so my parents got lucky with that since they understand Mandarin more  than English. Really liked the inside self-tour of the ship, it was very big and impressive inside.

Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum - Eh, technically could've skipped it's small. I paid extra for the simulator which was fun. The walk to see the Hanger with the bullet holes felt quite far in the heat. They were setting up a special event inside so couldn't go into the hanger just could look in from outside. Did not go up the tower.

Got back by 1230 to the main Pearl Harbor area, had a simple sandwich lunch from the snack shops and browsed the exhibits. Got impatient waiting for the 145pm USS Arizona reservation and walked over at 120pm... the 1:30pm the entire standby line cleared and we got in earlier. It was a nice boat ride, felt a bit solemn going onto the memorial. (We skipped the pre-boat movie since it didn't match with our timing and they don't require it anymore before the boat ride,)

USS Bowfin - Did this at the end. Going into USS Bowfin was probably one of the most fun parts in addition to the USS Missouri. Was a bit tired out of museum exhibits so just breezed through the submarine museum part.

It is also my mom's birthday... we went to **Mai Tai Bar at Royal Hawaiian** for dinner, big mistake trying to walk there from our hotel... Google maps said 0.6 miles but it felt a lot farther.

Hoping to catch the free **Kuhio beach Hula show** \>>> This didn't happen, LOL.

**Day 3 -** Booked a **Circle Tour that included Byudo-In Temple** **-** Biggest mistake... I didn't realize Byudo-In temple is located in a cemetery. That was a big no-no to my traditional Asian parents... to go to a cemetery while on vacation. They didn't think the circle tour was that amazing, they said they rather just sit on the hotel lanai and stared at the beach all day. Bought lots of Macadamia Nuts...

Had dinner at  Liliha Bakery @ International Marketplace  and caught a glimpse of their Hula show.

**Day 4** \- **~~Iolani Palace~~** ~~tour in the morning, head to Chinatown for lunch ( Maguro Brothers), then~~ **~~Bishop Museum~~** ~~in the afternoon...~~ **~~Helena's~~** ~~for dinner.~~  **Tour of Iolani Palace** \- was decent, they had elevators so was better for my parents to not have to climb the stairs. Loved the learning the history of Hawaii from the volunteer docents. Recommend it

**Chinatown** \- Well Maguro Brother was closed this entire week after Memorial Day :(. Googled another local place that had good reviews for lunch. **Lam's Kitchen**, it was very busy insidebut you wouldn't have guessed from the outside and how empty the streets were. Coming from NYC, we were shocked at the state of Chinatown in Honolulu. Got some Lychees because I love lychees.

**Nutridge Luau** \- for dinner. We were unfortunate... it started raining.... as a matter of fact, **it rained almost every night we went to have dinner during this entire trip**, but it rained the most at this luau. I changed to this luau due to recommendations on this reddit. The food was good but my parents didn't think it was worth the cost per person. The show was decent but they didn't have a huge cast of dancers and the fire dancer's skills felt kind of average.

**Day 5 -**  **Glassbottom Boat Tour**  ~~in morning... then... not fully planned (thinking about renting a Hui  car and driving up to Tantalus or Punchbowl) then get food around  Kapahulu Ave, Leonard's/shaved ice.... then beach/pool time?~~ **This was the highlight of the trip!!! It was a beautiful day....** forget the glass bottom... there wasn't much to see there **but we kept having spinner dolphins show up all around our boat popping right in front of us and beside us, we also spotted a turtle just as we were about to leave port.**

Went to **Island Vintage Shaved Ice** after, most amazing shaved ice we've ever had entire trip Super soft fluffy ice and soft serve inside.

**Helena's** for lunch... made a mistake not checking in on yelp before hand because got distracted chatting with the Uber driver. Had to wait 30-40 minutes but the food was overall decent, and got to try poi which we didn't finish, lols... had Uber driver pit stop in Chinatown for more Lychees LOL...

**Hilton Waikiki evening fireworks show**.  Oceanfront room... we thought about going downstairs to watch from the beach but then saw the huge crowds and decided nah... we'll stay on the Lanai. Still got a very good view from the side, never have been this close to fireworks before.

**Day 6 - Fly to Kona, flight arrives around 1130am...**  Booked **Royal Kona Resort**, ocean view room wasn't ready yet, checked luggage and grabbed lunch (**Island Lava Java)** and explored Farmer's Market and got almost $40 worth of fruit... lychees, longans, mangos, dragonfruit, apple bananas... **Kona Brewing** for dinner. **The waves on the rocks were so loud, it felt like there was a storm going on every night, it was much more relaxing in Hilton Waikiki Village.** 

**Day 7** \- **Circle Tour of Big Island with Wasabi Tours** that included: a coffee plantation, Punalau'u bake shop, black sand beach, VNP (crater rim hike and thurston's lava tube), Big Island Candies, Rainbow Falls and Akaka Falls passing through Hilo and Waipo valley lookout. This tour was amazing, seeing the volcano, walking through the rainforest then seeing the coast at Waipo valley... the tour guide/driver even pulled over as the sun was setting for us to watch. **This tour was long and tiring..... the tour operator initially told us we'd be back around 7... it started raining heavily... and we didn't make it back till 8pm.** Our hotel restaurant wouldn't take anymore people because they were closing 8:30pm.... and it was raining so heavily, we were too tired to walk in the heavy rains to see what other restaurants might still take us so we didn't eat dinner at all that evening.... we just ate the sweet bread we got at punalu'u bake shop and the fruit from the day before and went to bed. **We def did not plan/expect how early restaurants close on the Big Island.**

**Day 8** \- **~~Kealakekua Snorkel & Sail~~** ~~, leaves from Kailua pier so walkable from our hotel. Then~~ **~~Kona Brewing~~** ~~in afternoon and head back for the~~ **~~Luau at Royal Kona Resort.~~** Slept in, had coffee at local coffee shop and light lunch at the hotel. On arrival we had changed to **Afternoon Snorkel & Sail** **with Fair Winds,** took **Uber** there and back (I booked the Lyft back 10 min before getting off the boat... took almost 25 minutes total for driver to arrive). It was cloudy and raining nearby but it didn't rain on us in the bay. I had a lot of fun snorkelling for the first time, got to see lots of fish and spinner dolphins greeted us as we left the bay. 

Had dinner again at the hotel afterwards due being tired to call an uber to go elsewhere. We could see parts of the luau, they have a better fire dancer than at Nutridge luau.

**Day 9 -**  Flexible day....We cancelled our rental car pick-up.... and travelled along the free Kona Trolley. Went to **Ali'i Gardens Marketplace** it was not very impressive, most stores weren't open yet at 10am... then made of mistake of walking what was supposed to be 0.5miles to **Da Poke Shack** instead of waiting another hour for the trolley to pass... the distance felt soo much longer than walking in NYC. **Da Poke Shack** was amazing though... The Shack Special poke was soo good and I wish I can find Taegu here in NYC too because that was good too, took trolley down to **Kahalu'u Beach Park**, I didn't bring my snorkelling gear but I should have, the entrance and exit into the water is easy and there's lots of people around. And the fish come up to the edge of the rocks too. Finished off the trip with dinner at **Hugo's on the rocks**, got a nice oceanside table too to watch the sunset.

**Day 10 - Fly home....**  Kƒ´lauea decided to start erupting that morning, I found out as we were waiting for our flight back to Honolulu and home. :( Pele's revenge/mocking us esp for my mom wanting to see a volcano but talking shit about how creepy the black rocks and sand environment was.

**TLDR**: It was overall a good first trip despite some mis-haps.  I hope to come back eventually to see Maui and do more hiking in Hawaii. Things I would say to first timers to Hawaii...Don't worry about the weather, it's so unpredictable... lots of random tiny showers and then the unfortunate heavy rains here or there. Esp if you go to the Big island.... have dinner early if possible, most places close by 9pm. And expect to wait at least half an hour to be seated... I just can't imagine how bad the crowds are in peak summer season.

It's expensive.... as expensive as NYC... maybe even a bit more than NYC.",VisitingHawaii

We didn't make it to Hilo the first trip, so we split our time this trip. The botanical gardens were great, and it was much closer to Volcanoes National Park, also great. But, it rained a lot every day. Hilo gets three times as much annual rain as Seattle. Ugh. Akaka Falls was nice, but busy. We also stopped at a goat sanctuary near the falls. If we had to do it over, we would only have spent one night in Hilo.

Kona is paradise. Sunny, warm. The best food we've had on the island was at Merriman's Waimea, 65-1227 Opelo Rd B, Waimea, HI 96743. Five star food and service (five star prices). Wow. We stayed at one of the four cottages at Lava Lava Beach Club, booked 11 months in advance. We did Mauna Kea last trip, wanted to hike Mauna Loa, but it was still closed from the 2022 eruption.

I have a few health issues so I can't do anything too strenuous, and I love the beach and water activities. Just looking for a quiet, relaxing vacation.

1. Having trouble narrowing down where to stay. I don't have a driver's license so I'm limited by Uber - that's why I picked Waikiki, but I would consider other places/islands if not having a driver's license wouldn't be a problem there. I'm not sure how I feel about staying in the city (would prefer to be more in nature) but I would for sure like to sleep somewhere quiet. Is there somewhere I'd be able to walk to the beach very easily? I'm not necessarily looking for a wild island adventure, more of a ""sit on a beach, wade in the water, read a book, see some fish, walk to little restaurant and eat fish"" kind of thing. My budget is about $2000 (edit, for accommodations only) for reference and I'm open to resorts or hotels, so feel free to recommend specific places or just areas. If I had infinite money I'd do a resort but I don't think that's in my budget.
2. Looking to go for about a week within the next 2 months. I'd ideally like to go mid-late January - any recommendations otherwise? Honestly I'd like to go asap.

I am flying from the East Coast, and it takes 13+ hours to get there. I have always wanted to visit Hawaii, so I've decided to take this opportunity and spend several more days there. I have heard wonderful things about Big Island; it feels wild and remote. Combined with the chance to see glowing lava, it makes me want to squeeze the Big Island into my trip.  I am planning to budget the trip for about $2500, I don't have to pay for the two nights at the hotel on Maui. Looking at the flight costs, it's about $700 for both islands.

On Maui, I want to do stargazing and watch the sunrise at Haleakala National Park, go snorkeling at Molokini, and drive the Road to Hana. Not a fan of black sand beaches, blowholes, and smaller waterfalls, so I am only interested in 2-3 stops on the Road to Hana (hiking the bamboo forest and hiking to a waterfall). I am wondering if I can do both Haleakala and the Road to Hana in one day given how close they are or if that would be too much.  I am thinking of leaving another day as a buffer after the wedding in case of excessive drinking; I could use this day to visit beaches, enjoy food, and relax.

On the Big Island, I would like to explore Volcanoes National Park, snorkel with manta rays, and potentially spend another day visiting beaches and the famous waterfall.

Any feedback on our proposed plan below? We're thinking 12 days - Honolulu 5 days, North Shore/Kaneohe/Kailua 4 days, Hilo 3 days.

Especially interested in your feedback if this is too busy or there are better ways to schedule the driving/itinerary or routes in Oahu. I hear traffic can be intense in peak periods on the North Shore. 

My partner & I are interested in beaches, food, & culture.
 
Day 1 (Sun): Fly into Honolulu, stay the night & orientate ourselves. 

Day 2 (Mon): Drive from Honolulu to North Shore via Haleiwa, and stay somewhere there (looking at options currently). Do Toa Luau in evening. 

Day 3 (Tues): Go to ClimbWorks Ziplines + Gunstock Ranch horse riding.

Day 4 (Wed): Visit Kaneohe, visit beach, possibly Byodo-Inn Temple, visit Wed market.

Day 5 (Thurs): Free day/ beach or Kaneohe again or Kailua?

Day 6 (Fri): Drive back to Honolulu, grab lunch somewhere local & fly to Hilo in the evening. Arrive in Hilo, grab food and check into accomodation.

Question: Is the above too busy especially considering traffic driving around the North Shore in the July period?

Rest of the trip below;

Day 7 (Sat): Hilo market + explore town.

Day 8 (Sun): Farm or orchard tours.

Day 9 (Mon): Hilo in morning + Return to Honolulu in afternoon.

Day 10 (Tues) to Day 12 (Thurs): Splurge our savings ü§£ at a resort to relax and enjoy the beach. Also visit attractions around Honolulu (Pearl Harbour, shopping, Iolani Palace, local eateries etc.).",VisitingHawaii

1703133891.0,Honolulu in mid January,"Hi all,

We're staying at Embassy Suites and Hilton Hawaiian Village in mid-Jan for a week.

Three questions:  

1. I know December is super rainy and January is still fairly rainy.  What is a typical mid-January week like - is it going to likely rain on us most of the day every day?
2. Near Embassy Suites and Hilton Hawaiian Village, are there any good value for the $ places to eat?
3. I happen to enjoy getting wet fully clothed (the more clothes the merrier, long story) but I'm also somewhat self-conscious about doing so in public.  Are there any good places to go where either a. hardly any people won't be around or b. people won't think anything of it or c. lots of others are also going to be doing the same thing and i'll fit right in? lol

Thanks!

1703136576.0,Kahala or Halekulani?,"Third time to Oahu, previously stayed at the Four Seasons, then Turtle Bay. I hike every morning and make it back for noon to spend the rest of the day by the pool/beach with my wife.

Four Seasons & Turtle Bay were both incredible. Would do either one again except‚Ä¶ Four Seasons is still a bit more expensive/a bit out of the way & Turtle Bay is obviously very far from most hikes (ie leaving at 3am for sunrise on Olomana). We were pretty set on Kahala as we never had a desire to stay in Waikiki given we‚Äôre coming from New York, but I‚Äôve heard two coworkers rave about it, saying once you‚Äôre on property you would never know you‚Äôre in Waikiki. (We‚Äôve been to Oahu twice for at least 8 days and have yet to go to Waikiki)

Given the time my wife will spend on resort, I‚Äôd like to make sure either are at least comparable to the experience of the Four Seasons or Turtle Bay, though obviously tough to beat. This is probably the most important factor - is one more comparable than the other?
Given the hiking I‚Äôll be doing, I‚Äôll be driving all along the Ko‚Äôolau, the Halekulani is closer to most spots but driving through the city, again, from NY, acceptable but not preferred

I'm from New Zealand and will be visiting Hawai'i in July 2024. Doing some advanced planning now as I know that's a busy season (unfortunately the only time me and my partner can travel). We're very excited for the trip :)

We're planning on doing 13 days/12 nights in total - split between Oahu for 8-9 days and Hilo for 3-4 days.

Questions I'm keen to get some feedback on from locals or those familiar:

- Is 8-9 days in Oahu OK? (We're planning to stay for 4-5 days in Honolulu itself, and then 2-3 days in the windward or North Shore areas).

- Is it better to stay in North Shore or the windward areas (Kaneohe etc.)? Any recommendations between the two? I'm finding it hard to choose between the two ü§£ 

- Should we spend more than 3 days in Hilo? (I.e. by reducing the time we spend in Oahu)


We're keen to do some touristy stuff, but generally looking for a more chill & low key relaxing vibe for most of the trip - hence why we're hoping spending time in the windward side or North Shore areas od Oahu would be better, plus Hilo as well.

We rented a kayak and pulled up to the beach by ourselves and just kind got cold feet. There were white caps on waves, and we only had a rough explanation of how to paddle to the island (go out straight for a bit and then hang a left to the island in a kind of L shape rather than heading straight for it) and no real support in case anything got weird. After some hesitation we decided to pack it up and head over to Kualoa Ranch for the day instead.

I'm still wondering if we made the right decision, we were both really looking forward to kayaking and are kind disappointed we didn't go, but we also may not have done enough research in the first place.

Before the trolls start commenting with ‚ÄúyOu NeEd 20 DaYs on EaCH IslAND‚Äù make sure to read the entire post. 

For quick context - we are traveling from Atlanta, GA and will not go back to Hawaii for a long time after this trip. My wife is more into relaxing on the beach and maybe some adventure/hiking. I‚Äôm a scuba diver and love free diving/snorkeling as well. I‚Äôm also interested in the adventurous stuff. I‚Äôve heard the Big Island is best for Scuba but this is an anniversary trip so it‚Äôs not mandatory, especially if I can get a dive in on Maui or Lanai (is the snorkeling also better on Big island vs the other islands?).

The only historic/museum thing we would be interested in would be Pearl Harbor.  

Regarding travel time between islands: we are aware that this will take half or more of our days away to travel. We do also have TSA pre check and lounge access for the airports that have them, which will help. 

It‚Äôs just the two of us and when we traveled to French Polynesia, we went to 3 different islands in 10 days (also had to fly to each island) and it worked out fine for us. 

So we are trying to decide between: 

‚Ä¢ 5-6 nights in Maui + 5-6 nights in Kauai

OR

‚Ä¢ 4-5 nights one each of the islands (Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Big Island) - some islands would have 4 nights some would have 5 (please let me know suggestions). ***we would also be ok with doing 3 nights on one of the islands if you have recommendations on which island is best to spend the least time. 

From our initial research, it seems that most recommend spending more time on each island, but like I mentioned above, we were easily able to make a similar trip work with 3-4 nights per island. Please let me know your experience/suggestions.",VisitingHawaii

1702497282.0,Primitive Camping in Hawaii for Rural Native Alaskans,"Okay, so I ask all of this in good faith, in total seriousness, with no attempts to be rude to anyone.   


So, I have been living in Alaska for a few years now, I am white/from lower 48.  Growing up, I took several family vacations to Hawaii, as my uncle lived in Honolulu and my stepdad grew up there.    


Two of my friends have recently expressed an interest in visiting Hawaii. Especially as Alaska Air just bought Hawaiian Air, Hawaii has been coming up more in conversation.   


These two friends are both Alaska Native/from Alaska and have *never left the state* of Alaska except for brief trips when they were wildland forest fighting in National forests.   


They grew up *outside* of the village *completely in the bush* on their family's ancestral land near the Arctic Circle. I have been on multiple hunting, river float, and camping trips with them.   


They are both very skilled in bushcraft, building temporary structures, hunting & fishing off the land as they get hungry, building fires not in a pre-determined fire pit, etc.   


I haven't been to Hawaii since I was child, but I am fairly certain camping may be different there with more rules.   


They are hoping to visit Hawaii *this winter, like January.* Is this way too soon?   


Is there anywhere on the islands they would be able to camp where it wouldn't feel more urbanized? Any sort of camping with like, benches and predetermined fire pits is like ""city"" by their standards.   


What are the hunting regulations there? Are they going to get in huge trouble if they kill wildlife? Are they going to get in trouble if they have very large knifes, hatchets, firearms, harpoons, etc.?    


Mahalo and feel free to DM me. I mean this all in genuine earnestness, and I can't find much in all the info online about this (as most tourists to Hawaii probably are not Alaska Native people who grew up in the bush, lol). I want my friends to be able to enjoy Hawaii and not get arrested!

We will have a  rental car, so ok with driving to find a worthwhile food.  
 

Dec 17 Sunday -  Our flight from YYZ don't land till 7:50pm, between  getting our luggage, rental car, and checking into the hotel,  will be  pretty late,  any suggestions for a late eat nearby?  
 Dec 19 Tuesday -  Booked Senia for 9pm.  That was the only availability I  got for Senia during the days we are here.  They say they close at  9:30,  will a 9pm a la carte meal start be comfortable, or will they  rush us out?  and I should cancel and go somewhere else?  
 Dec 31 Sunday/NYE -  Right now made a cancellable reservation at Bali's  at HHV just for the convenience,  but was looking at the Halekunai's NYE   Ballroom dinner/party or House without a keys dinner.  Any other  suggestion for a NYE dinner/party?  
 Jan 2 Tuesday -  We have a redeye flight out at 11pm back to YVR/YYZ.   Figure this day would be good to try out Haleweia Joe's,  get there  maybe around 3-4pm and wait in line,  have dinner, then have plenty of  time to make our way to the airport?  Seems sound?  
 

Now the other nights,  we are open, and just starting to research and  make reservations, so far the shortlist are in no particular order:  
 Pai  
 Mud Hen Water  
 Nico's  (Do they take reservations?   how busy do they get?)  
 Pig and the Lady  
 House without a key  
 Yakitori Hachibei  
 Roy's Hawaii Kai  
 Beach House Moana  
 53 By the Sea  
 Fete    
 100 Sails  
 Michele's

1702135818.0,"Just got back from Kauai, here's what all we did for those looking for itinerary ideas","Super long post with our detailed itinerary!

Kauai was amazing. Like actually the most incredible place I've ever had the privilege of experiencing. We also had the privilege of meeting and talking to some locals and they were all so kind and helpful. Just all-in-all an incredible place. I spent months putting together our itinerary trying to get it perfect so I figured there are others who might appreciate seeing what we did and what our experience was. We actually didn't get to half the things on my itinerary just because a lot of things ended up taking longer than expected, and it was nice to just take in views, chill, etc.

We were there 11/30-12/7. We stayed in Poipu at an airbnb the entire time and don't regret that decision at all. It's easy to drive to the other parts of the island and the drives are beautiful, recommend renting a jeep or something you can take the top down :)

Thurs: Arrived, picked up Turo car, checked into airbnb. One thing to note is that it might take you an hour or more to get from airport to rental car. They have a designated lot for Turo cars that's 15ish minutes from the airport and they run a shuttle every 25 minutes.

Fri: Got groceries from Big Save market, mostly breakfast items and snacks for hikes. Walked around exploring Poipu and chilled at the beach. Had reservation at Tidepools. Highly recommend this restaurant for a date night or special occasion. The food was great but the atmosphere was better. This was my favorite restaurant of trip.

Sat: Drove to Waimea early and did the Nualolo trail. HIGHLY recommend this trail if you are able. It does have relatively intense elevation gain (approx. 2500ish ft) and all of the gain is on the way back to the trail head. We are experienced hikers and did not bring enough water, I would bring a liter per person at minimum. The views at the end of this trail are insane. We passed one other person on this hike and he said though its more challenging, the views are better than the very popular Awa'awapuhi.

After hike we got food at Koke'e lodge restaurant which was great, highly recommend. Then we took our time driving back to Poipu and eventually got Da Crack for dinner. It was so-so. If you're looking for quick to-go food it's a good option.

Sun: Drove North. Drove through Princeville which was beautiful and looked for Hideaways beach but was told that it was closed due to swells. Made our way to Hanalei beach. We walked super far left on Hanalei beach and came to the mouth of a stream with a really small beach. I think it was Waioli stream which you are able to swim in. FYI there's no swimming at Hanalei beach. Then we drove to Anini beach which had gorgeous, swimmable water. The actual beach is really small but worth the visit if you are dying to swim. Had lunch at Kalypso's which was really good, definitley recommend. Did some shopping around Hanalei and made our way back to Poipu. Got dinner at Keoki's which was also really good.

Mon: Had parking reservation at Ha'ena state park. Recommend getting parking if you can, we were really muddy and gross after hiking and it was nice to have the car there with stuff to change, etc. Did the Kalalau trail (first couple miles that are allowed without a camping permit) and it was stunning. I think the trail itself is the best part of this hike. There are amazing viewpoints along the way to stop and see the Na'pali coast and the plants and nature along the trail is amazing. (Big houseplant lover here). As relatively experienced hikers (spent a couple years in CO and have done some 14'ers) we considered this trail pretty easy. Not a lot of elevation gain, the most challenging parts are the slippery/muddy parts and crossing the stream to the ""beach"" at the end. Next trip we hope to get camping reservations to do the entire 22 miles. Recommend starting this trail early, we didn't see many people on our way out and skies were really clear, then on our way back there were tons of hikers, waiting to take photos at different spots, etc. Also, some clouds had rolled in and the view wasn't as clear. Had lunch at Opakapaka grill which was very good and they made really strong drinks! Drove back toward the state park and parked in front of Ha'ena beach. Checked out the dry cave and walked on Tunnels beach. No swimming in winter but views were great. Grabbed Volcano pizza in Poipu for dinner - it was so-so.

Tues: Doors off Heli ride with Air Kauai. It was awesome and also terrifying. Highly recommend if you can fit it in your budget, especially for winter months if you are worried about taking a boat tour. For people with long hair, you should tie your hair up as TIGHTLY as humanly possible. I brushed my hair out for over an hour after the doors-off ride and still had to rip a bunch out because of knots :) Then we went to Poipu beach and Brenneckes for dinner. This was my least favorite restaurant of the trip. Had a long wait and food wasn't worth it in my opinion.

Weds: Poipu beach and snorkeling all day and stopped at Old Koloa town for some shopping. Got a fresh coconut from a food truck and some sushi. This area has lots of good food trucks to choose from.

Thurs: Anuenue cafe for breakfast, highly recommend. Shopped around Poipu shopping village, went to Poipu beach, and packed up.

We made a few different stops to Anake's juice bar for a√ßa√≠ bowls during our trip that I didn't include above. This place was one of my favorites and the little grocery store that its in was also good for healthier grocery options. We got ice cream from Lappert's one night which was fantastic. I wish we had a few more days to go back out to Waimea and do more hikes but it was the trip of a lifetime regardless.

The reviews are decent for Star Cruise overall, there were some negatives about the cleanliness, cockroaches, and how tight the tables were.

Prior to going my husband and I agreed that the world is so large (and we are not rich, so therefore cannot travel everywhere, all the time) that we would probably never go back so we saved a bunch and did every single thing we thought was worth doing so we would have no regrets, but since returning home I find myself so, so sad. Going to work is harder and I enjoy my job! We joke about selling everything and moving there, but I know it's not realistic to live there, heck I'm not sure it's even realistic/cost effective to go back again (15hr travel day) but that hasn't stopped us from talking about how we could go again and do it for less than we did. We even joked we could just go camp there for months at a time and get a hotel the days the campground is closed, etc.

I guess what I'm asking is, is there anyway to stop feeling sad/depressed about a place so awesome? Is there anyone who lives as far away (or further) than I do that has still made it a priority to go again and again? How do you justify it when the world is so big and there's so many places to see?

We are visiting again upcoming Jan and this time I am going to use National Executive row and wondering what is expectation like. 

Any one with National EX at HNL? How was your experience and what did you end up with? 

based on flyertalk, you could end up with anywhere between Camry and Audi Q5.

1701742637.0,Kaena Point Vehicle Permits as of 2023-2024,"curious how this will go... asking anyway.

we've been to oahu multiple times over 10+ years and also driven our vehicle (with permission) out to the gate quite a few times.

when we started visiting there was no gate and then the last time we were headed to oahu and wanted to go i saw we needed to apply for a permit, i did the paperwork and paid the fees and when i went to go pick up my shit the auntie looked at me like umm you don't live here? i was like naw and then she told me i could pick 1 full day to go. no big deal. we drove out to the dog gate and watched a sunset and it was great.

tonight i checked and as of revision 11/13/18 it now states..  (not my typo btw)

>Who is eligible for a permit? Anyone residing on Oahu, having a valid driver‚Äôs license (including Out-of-State licenses), and being 18 years of age or older may aply for a permit.

so it sounds like either..

1. it was cool in 2018 and changed that year or...
2. it was like this in 2018 and she was just like ""hey put your lodging address here"" and looked the other way because i am a nice and respectful person or...
3. i'm shit out of luck cause all of *those people* ruined it for everyone else. (you know exactly who i'm talking about)

thoughts?

it's not a make or break for the trip but it's been a while since we have been out there because of covid. curious if anyone has any recent experience.

also, before anyone says anything: we stick to the main trail, pulling over for locals in their suzuki samurais and shit, just leisurely make it out to the gate and then walk to the point for a sunset and do the same back. i have seen what contributes to the erosion, etc and it is definitely not us LOL.

just looking for the facts. thanks!",VisitingHawaii

1695442995.0,Report on my trip to the Big Island (without a car)!,"A few weeks ago I made a post asking how to get around on the Big Island without a car. I'm 27 and I'm on the autism spectrum and I've always wanted to solo travel, but aside from a short trip to Alberta I've never done it. My first idea was to go to Costa Rica, but where it's my first time traveling alone I (and my mom) was a bit apprehensive and I decided to stick to somewhere in the US. I have a special interest in birds so I booked a birdwatching tour in Hawai'i. I did a bit of research and everyone seemed to stress that getting around without a rental car would be challenging; I'm not very comfortable driving and I've never owned a vehicle so getting a car was out of the question.

Day 1: I flew into Kona and took the Hele-on bus to the stop at Target and walked the rest of the way (about 20 minutes) into town. I got in pretty late and it was already dark so there wasn't really time to do or see anything, I ate a couple of spam and egg musubi from the ABC store and just went straight to sleep.

Day 2: Woke up early and walked to a small public access bit of coastline to sit and relax, struck up a conversation with a lady living nearby who offered me a bottle of water and a lift to Magic Sands beach. After spending an hour or so at the beach I took the trolley to Target and quickly bought a snack before catching the #1 bus to Hilo. The bus arrived early but it waited until the scheduled time to depart, I didn't find the buses nearly as unreliable as I've seen people claim online. The toilets don't work but the driver made a quick stop in Honoka'a, about the halfway point, for people to use the bathroom. It's like a greyhound style bus and the seats are pretty comfortable. While doing research for the trip I was afraid of taking seats on the bus that locals rely on to get around, but none of the buses I took were ever even half full. There's no drinking or eating on the bus and it is enforced; I saw the driver yell at a group of backpackers for trying to eat popcorn. The trip was about 3.5 hours, I listened to music and chatted a bit to an older man sitting behind me. It's also a great way to see the natural landscape of the island. This was my favourite spot, when the road comes out from a dense bit of forest and then suddenly you're greeted with this sight:

https://preview.redd.it/x29olqk5mxpb1.jpg?width=4413&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c5751ac43a9648d02ee67333b6a4da6814c53f0

After getting to Hilo it was around 4pm, so I just sat on the beach and watched the waves a bit until dark, and got spicy Tonkotsu ramen at a nearby restaurant called Kenichi, then headed to bed.

Day 3: Went to Two Ladies kitchen because it was very hyped online and I love mochi, spent like half an hour in line but it was pretty good. I more or less spent the day just walking around Hilo and exploring the shops, bought a few souvenirs that would fit in my backpack, got some local fruit at the farmers market and checked out the MokupƒÅpapa discovery center, which I would recommend if you're interested in marine biology or maritime history. Went to rainbow falls as well, I took the bus there and just walked back. The sun was intense, I got a pretty bad sunburn on my hairline because I wasn't wearing a hat.

Day 4. Planned to go hiking in Volcanoes, there's a bus that goes there from Hilo every couple hours, if you miss it and end up calling a Lyft like I did it's around 70 dollars. I read online that the Kipukapuaulu trail was pretty good for spotting birds so I got dropped off up there, but I didn't have any luck and when I mentioned to a local couple out hiking that I'd been hoping to get some pictures of an 'apapane they offered me a ride to an area they knew had a lot of them (and they were right!). I spent the rest of the day just hiking around the park and got the last bus back to Hilo. There was a lot of steam coming from Kilauea and I noticed it was increasing throughout the day, I remember wondering if it was going to erupt soon; and of course it did the day I got home. Another thing I noticed was that not many people seemed to be using the stations they have around to disinfect your boots, sometimes they'd stop to read the sign and then just walk past.

Day 5: Honestly, most of the day was spent on the bus, made it back to Kona in time to watch the sunset and get dinner, some really sub-par fish and chips and a couple glasses of beer from a restaurant I don't remember the name of.

Day 6: Went up to Hakalau forest on a guided tour (the main thing I came for!) and saw all of the beautiful forest birds (except for the Palila), like this 'I'iwi which was definitely the highlight of the trip:

https://preview.redd.it/ra8x7lty2wpb1.jpg?width=2335&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77b30910e067e2f4d79d8229900dc98d6bdfacdf

It was about 5 hours total in a van and 3 hours of looking at birds, but we all had a blast. After getting back at 6pm I had a bowl of udon soup from Seiji's sushi in Kona. I was too nervous to ask for a fork so I had to figure out how to use chopsticks very quickly and managed to do so without making a mess.

Day 7: I made friends with another tourist, she had a rental car so I was able to ride around with her a bit, we went hiking up on the Pu'u O'o trail (I was still trying to get a better 'I'iwi picture; it didn't happen) and went to the Kaumana caves, then drove up around the island back to Kona. We stopped at a gas station in Honoka'a to use the bathroom and I got a little bread pudding there that was probably my favourite thing I ate in Hawai'i. After getting back to Kona we went out drinking and did some karaoke.

Day 8: Friend and I checked out a craft market in Kona and went to a few different beaches looking for sea turtles, which we found many of at Kaloko-Honok≈çhau historical park along with a couple more endemic birds, the Hawaiian stilt and coots. It was hard to even stay far enough away from the turtles because they were coming so close to shore and the tide was fully in so there was only a couple feet of sand. We went to Leilani's shave ice afterwards since it was highly recommended online, and it was indeed pretty amazing. I don't usually like the texture of stuff like sno cones but the ice was ground really fine and the flavours were very natural. I spent the last hour exploring shops in Kona and bought myself a jar of the Big Island bees Ohia honey before I got a ride to the airport and had to fly out that night at 7pm. Of course I completely forgot that you can't take large jars of liquid in your carry-on and the TSA took the jar. Oh well.

Overall it was pretty fun. I was a little worried about hostility toward visitors when I went since I have pretty severe social anxiety and read online other tourists saying that people in Hawaii were so rude to them that they wouldn't go back. I can confidently say I didn't experience anything like that, the majority of people I encountered were as polite as anyone in my city would be and some were very helpful.

I don't recommend trying to get around without a vehicle unless you have no choice! I did miss some of the places I wanted to see, like Akaka Falls, Pu'u O Umi and Mauna Kea and spent a lot of time on the bus but it was still 100% worth it and I feel confident enough to try an international destination by myself, and maybe when I get some driving practice I'll come back someday and get a rental car.

1650913018.0,Oahu Trip Using The Bus System Only No Rental Car,"I wanted to share a bit about my recent Oahu vacation from the perspective of using public transit instead of renting a car to get around the island. In short, it worked amazingly well! Coming into the trip I was a bit nervous about whether I‚Äôd be able to see and do everything I wanted to for the week I was on the island, but I found the bus system to work extremely well and was able to hit basically all the spots I wanted. 

As a disclaimer though, if you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt like walking 15-20 mins at time to catch a bus, or waiting for the bus, or somewhat longer trips, this post won‚Äôt be helpful for you. However, I think that the trade off for hundreds of dollars saved on not having a renal, none of the headache of parking and driving in traffic, and the beautiful island scenery on the bus trips were well worth it. Not to mention the CO2 offsetting from using transit!

As a note, I stayed in Waikiki, which although was a bit of a dystopian tourist hellscape, was well connected to all bus routes I needed. I didn‚Äôt actually spend much time in Waikiki however but it was a good hub. 

I went ahead and bought a Holo card (can buy at any ABC store) and filled it with two 3 day passes and a one day pass to cover my 7 days. I think at 7-11 you may be able to fill with a cash value to make it easier. It is $5.50 per day, for unlimited rides.

So here is my itinerary and brief notes about transit for a couple spots. I also ranked each attraction on a five star scale if anyone is planning a trip, feel free to comment with more questions about the particulars of each part: 

Monday: Waikiki and Surroundings
- Waikiki and Diamond head are all very close so the bus system were very simple here. 
- [ ] Diamond head crater hike (5/5)
- [ ] Snorkeling at queens beach (3/5)
- [ ] Dinner at five star poke (4/5)

Tuesday: West Isle
- The West isle bus ride was more on the long side, but still very accessible and super scenic as well. I basically rode an express bus all the way to makaha beach, then made my way down the coast. 
- [ ] Makaha beach snorkeling (4/5)
- [ ] Lunch at poki beach shack (3/5)
- [ ] Electric beach snorkeling (4/5)
- [ ] Dinner at Zigu (3/5)

Wednesday: SouthEast isle
- Hanauma got a bit complicated because they removed the bus stop that‚Äôs right by the entrance, so you do have to walk along Kalaniana‚Äôole road for a bit, however there is a guardrail and grass path by the road for most of it. As an additional note Koko head was amazing but I almost died from heat exhaustion near the top so highly recommend going at a non peak sun time!!
- [ ] Hanauma bay (5/5)
- [ ] Leonard‚Äôs bakery lunch (3/5)
- [ ] Koko head hike (5/5 but go early in morn or late in day!)
- [ ] Ono poke dinner (5/5)

Thursday: East Isle
- [ ] Byodo-In temple (3.5/5)
- [ ] Poi factory lunch (4/5)
- [ ] Ho‚Äôomaluhia botanical gardens (5/5)
- [ ] Maguro bros poke dinner (3.5/5)

Friday: North Shore
- North shore was the longest ride clocking around 2.5hr, however the bus basically wraps around the entire north coast or the island, which is absolutely gorgeous.
- [ ] Laniakea beach (4/5)
- [ ] Giovanni‚Äôs shrimp (5/5)
- [ ] Sharks cove (4/5)
- [ ] Ted‚Äôs bakery (5/5)
- [ ] Olay‚Äôs Thai Lao cuisine (4/5)

Saturday: East Isle 2
- For Lanikai pillbox I took the bus to the entrance that leads to pillbox 2 first, which I recommend it you want a longer hike with less other people at the start. 
- [ ] Lanikai pillbox long route (4.5/5)
- [ ] Bob‚Äôs pizza (3/5)
- [ ] Kailua beach and swim to popoia isle (4/5)
- [ ] Manoa chocolate factory (5/5)

Sunday: Honolulu
- Again getting around Honolulu is very easy with transit, so even if you‚Äôre not gonna use busses for all of the trip, using it for days you stay in Waikiki and Honolulu is smart I feel. 
- [ ] Foster botanical garden (4.5/5)
- [ ] Morning catch poke lunch/dinner (5/5)
- [ ] Punch bowl crater/cemetery (4/5)
- [ ] Double three ice cream waffle (3.5/5)

1657132700.0,Post Trip Write-Up: Two Weeks on Big Island,"Hello everyone!

&#x200B;

I have used this sub (and the previous sub) extensively over the last 5 months to plan my two week vacation to Big Island. We just got back, and I wanted to share my feedback on everything we did. Some things we found on here, others we found on our own. We broke out our trip with a break to visit Hilo in the middle, but I am going to group the things we did by region to make it easier for others to navigate. The only thing we didn't get to do that I am disappointed we missed out on was a snorkeling trip to Captain Cook, however, we have some new snorkelers in our party who got hurt at Two Step (while my husband and I were in Hilo) and didn't have the heart to continue anymore.

&#x200B;

I strongly feel that two weeks was the perfect amount of time to spend on the island. By the end, I felt satisfied and ready to go home.

We had a fair amount of free time in our schedule for driving around and exploring different areas, which worked out great because our car rental place surprise upgraded us to a convertible. HIGHLY RECOMMEND splurging for it or accepting the upgrade if you get the opportunity (if you are a small group--we were a party of 2 and barely fit all our luggage in the car). We saw many other rental convertibles who didn't have their tops down at all, but we have a convertible at home and were comfortable with getting caught in the rain and potentially having to put the top up. Big Island had awesome huge shoulders on the sides of the roads almost everywhere we went if we needed to put the top up or wanted it take it down :)

&#x200B;

**Kona (including resorts north of Kona)**

For the duration of our trip, we had a two bedroom suite at Kona Coast Resort. It was fine, I didn't spend much time in the room besides showering and sleeping and it met all of our needs. My main two complaints were that the AC didn't seem to do a good job dehumidifying so our beach clothes took a long time to hang dry and that we did see quite a few roaches. I'm from Florida, so I'm used to roaches, but I also know that it is possible to keep them at bay. My MiL and SiL had a lower budget than my husband and I did, and this gave them access to walk to many beaches nearby.

Activities:

* Kahalu'u Beach Park
   * This beach's best quality was that it was two minutes from our hotel with decent snorkeling. The new snorkelers in our group got to use this area to learn while the more experienced snorkelers could go out past the buoys to see a little bit more life. Definitely advise going when the sea is more calm
* Kiholo Bay\*
   * We stopped here on the way up to Canoe House as something to do. Saw some sea turtles, but quickly got rained out, so we didn't get to do the hike over to Queen's Bath.
* Parrots in Paradise Parrot Sanctuary
   * You guys. This was a highlight that I definitely thought would just be ""that thing we did"" on the vacation. Boy was I wrong. My husband found this on AirBnB Experiences and was so excited as he has a love for parrots and I refuse to let us get one. This place was incredible. We went on a beautiful day, and the land that they have there is up on the mountain side with a gorgeous view. They have hundreds of parrots, all living outside in appropriately sized cages, and the owner definitely shows his love for the birds as he tells you about the history of each individual bird and how they came to be with their sanctuary. They have a couple of birds that are friendly enough for you to hold. I was terrified, but they were all so sweet and no one got nipped. I definitely recommend stopping by here if you care about birds at all.
* Magic Sands Beach
   * Magic Sands was okay. We went on a day where there was incredibly high surf. Had fun in the water for a couple hours bodysurfing or riding waves, but we definitely overstayed our welcome and slowly everyone got hurt and tapped out. A nice beach if you can walk to it, but definitely enjoyed other beaches more
* Manta Rays - Manta Adventures
   * Oh boy. I have read everything about how this is a once in a lifetime experience. A guy on our tour talked about how this would be a core memory for everyone and their kids, and he wasn't wrong... but it was the wrong kind of core memory. When we showed up at the dock, the captain told us that it was going to be incredibly rocky as the wind had really picked up. Someone asked if we would be rescheduling and he laughed and said he only rescheduled for lighting storms. Okay, whatever. We get out on the water, by the time we get to the snorkeling spot we have about an hour until the sun sets. The water was EXTREMELY rocky, and everyone was starting to feel sick. We were allowed to snorkel around a little to get in the water and get off of the rocky boat, which gave a slight reprieve from the seasickness... until we had to get back on and wait for an hour for the sun to set, while trying to get on our wetsuits. I think this was when the first person threw up from the seasickness. If you're not familiar, they have lights on the bottom of SUP boards that attract plankton that manta rays eat. Once we got in the water (many people sat out because they felt so sick), they told us if we felt sick while holding onto the SUP boards to push off and throw up then come back. After about 20 minutes (of the 45 that we were allowed to spend there) I did just that. Felt a little better after emptying my stomach, and went back to holding onto the SUP board. **For the entire 45 minutes, we saw 0 manta rays.** We then had to deal with the disappointing trip back where about half of the boat started throwing up.
   * Because we saw 0 rays, they assured us that we could re-book with them for free. Just call their main office and give them the date of the tour that we were on and they would get us in. I was prepared for this from reading other experiences that people had written about on here, so I had planned this the 2nd day (of 13) that we were in Hawaii. No problem, I thought, they will definitely get us in. Nope. No space. But I was assured that next time I come to Big Island I can go for free, which was massively disappointing. My husband pointed out that they would have no reason to squeeze us in if they could get paying customers instead.
   * To make matters worse, they talked the entire time about how great the private tour they did the day before was. We were originally scheduled to be on the tour the day before, but they called us a couple days ahead of time and said there was ""necessary boat maintenance"" and asked us to move our date. But god forbid they ask someone else to move their date so we could get in with the promised re-booking and see some rays before we left.
   * The only good thing I have to say was that the crew (besides the captain) was awesome. Drew was the lead and he had two assistants, Jewel and Bane, who were visiting from Texas for the summer helping him. It was great chatting with all of them and they did their best to make it a fun time, besides the sea sickness and the no manta rays.
* Mauna Kea Stargazing Tour\*
   * We did the stargazing tour the day after the manta ray disappointment, and boy did it help make up for it. We went with a company who claimed to be the OG company, who provided hot vegetarian lasagna at the visitor's center on the way up and hot chocolate during the stargazing, as well as parkas during the sunset. Our tour guide picked us up in Kona and drove us all the way there, answering all of our questions along the way, as well as pointing out a couple of interesting spots. The lasagna was surprisingly delicious, and on the way up to the summit our guide gave us some tips to help at the summit (breathing exercises, best way to move without over exerting yourself, etc) as well as stopping at some other telescopes and pointing out the permafrost locations. The parkas and gloves provided to keep us warm at the summit were amazing, and the sunset was absolutely beautiful. Right after, we loaded up in the van and headed down the mountain. After about two minutes he pulled into a parking lot and checked to see how everyone was doing with the altitude, and said if everyone was doing okay we could stay up here for the star gazing. We did, and it was incredible. He gave us guidelines for not using any phones or white light devices (only red lights allowed) for about 30 minutes until the stars came out to have our eyes adjust to see more stars. He had a telescope that he pulled out and set up to point out different things, as well as a laser pointer to point out constellations and satellites that were passing by. IMO this tour was 100% worth it, we had an amazing time. I also made sure we timed it so we were there on the new moon, which probably helped make the stars even more amazing.
* Buddha Coffee Deluxe Tour
   * This tour was good, but weird. We had had such a thorough farm tour on the Hilo side at Shark's (see below) that this tour seemed a bit lacking. Riding around the farm on the ATV was fun. The highlight was definitely a tasting session we had afterwards. We were paired with another couple (hi Laura and Zack if you're reading this!) who were great and very fun to get along with. We bought a bunch of coffee from here to take home.
* Hapuna Beach (twice)\*
   * Hapuna was a great beach, and my family enjoyed it so much we went twice. Good for boogie boarding, good for sandcastles, and good for sunbathing. Also close to Mauna Lani, where many of our dinner reservations were, so it was nice to have a place to go up and hang out for the afternoon before dinner.
* Shopping around to various artists markets
   * Don't have a ton to say about this, but my SiL is in a shopping phase right now and loved looking at all the different artists work. My husband and I got some Starfruit jelly to bring home which was delicious
* Mauna Kea (not tour)
   * We went back to Mauna Kea with my in laws on our last day, since they didn't come on the tour. We just took them up to the visitors center to watch the sunset. There's a small hill nearby where a crowd will form to watch the sun go down, which was very nice. It was definitely a great free alternative to the expensive tour.
* Old Kona Airport State Reception Area
   * First and foremost, if any locals want me to take this off of this list please let me know and I will be happy to remove it. On our last day (the 4th), we were driving around aimlessly looking for a place we could sit in our car and listen to a book on tape and have a good view. We stumbled upon this beach area, and boy did we have a great time. It was low tide, and there were tide pools everywhere filled with life for us to observe. There seemed to be VERY FEW tourists here, and as as hung out more and more locals showed up and set up huge 4th of July parties. We hung out here for about 4 hours, splitting our time between listening to our book in the car and walking around the beach. This was an awesome little hidden spot that I hadn't seen anywhere when I did my research ahead of time

Restaurants:

* Rebel Kitchen
   * Rebel kitchen was great. It was the first restaurant we went to on Big Island. My husband got a spicy curry and I got a hamburger and their pepperoni fries. We also got a cupcake dessert from them which was AMAZING. We enjoyed trying their homemade sauces as well.
* Canoe House\* (twice)
   * We originally planned to go to Canoe House only once, and do the chef's tasting. After our first visit, we made plans to go back again later in the trip. The chef's tasting was great BUT when we ordered off of the menu was when we had our best meal on the island. The corn ribs appetizer was incredible, I got the pork belly entree and my husband got the lamb, both were amazing. A A huge bonus to the delicious food is that the parking (valet only) is validated for 3 hours if you dine at the restaurant. Both times, we made a reservation for 7:15, arrived at the resort at 6:30 and found a nice spot to watch the sunset, then meandered over to the restaurant to finish watching the sunset and enjoy the amazing view.
* Chicken and Ribs roadside BBQ
   * We drove by this place with the top down on our car and it smelled so good that we had to go back. Also, the Parrots in Paradise guy recommended it. It was AMAZING.
* Umeke
   * Umeke was nice, we got to sit outside and listen to a live band. The food was nothing to write home about, but the poke I got there was definitely yummy.
* Big Jake's Island BBQ
   * Big Jake's was great, but the ribs and chicken at the roadside BBQ were definitely better. Where Jake got me was with his homemade lemonade and his spicy sausage, as well as just seeming like such a friendly and awesome dude. I hate spicy things but LOVE sausage, and I couldn't resist this and almost went back the next weekend. When we left, my husband and I got two lemonades to go. So delicious.
* Kona Coffee and Tea (twice)
   * Chill patio with chill owner who brings his dog (yay dog time!) and they have essentially a caramel frap but way better. Spent a couple hours here both times just relaxing.
* Kona Brewing
   * We went to try the pizza, but when we got there they said that due to being short staffed, they were closing the kitchen twice a week and bringing in food trucks to give their kitchen staff a break. A little disappointing since none of us drink, but the food trucks ended up being pretty good.
* Island Ono Loa Grill
   * Stopped by this place on the 4th to get a supposedly legendary burger to celebrate our country in the only way I had any interest in. I ordered the burger that had local goat cheese, local grass fed beef, locally grown mac nut pesto, and locally made bread. It was pretty yummy and the older gentleman running the counter was a nice guy who we chatted with for a while. I don't remember what my husband got because mine was better.
* Napua
   * Napua was the hardest restaurant to get into by far, so we had high hopes for it. High hopes that kind of fell flat. We had a wonderful seat and the food was okay, but having had our second Canoe House visit the day before, we were definitely let down. I think it would be worth it to go and eat during the sunset, but our reservation was at 8, so we watched the sunset at the beach in front of the restaurant and then ate in the dark afterwards. I did get a goat cheese and strawberry salad as an appetizer that was pretty good.

&#x200B;

**Hilo**

We stayed in a small AirBnB on someone's property. It was obviously a slightly-larger-than-tiny home that they had built for some extra revenue a couple years ago. It was well stocked and since we were on the south side of Hilo was great for easy access to VNP. One thing to note about Hilo: as you drive places, add like 15% of your time to get anywhere outside of the city due to road closures for tree trimming. This was totally unexpected and I am an early person so gave me lots of anxiety.

Activities:

* Honomu Goat Dairy
   * This was the main thing I wanted to do in Hilo. We had a blast. The goats were so cute, the goat goods were delicious. We bought a ton of things and the woman working the counter told us not to worry about paying for goat food and just gave us a couple bags. The edible goat goods (cheese, fudge, and caramels) were all AMAZING and were great snacks for the rest of the trip. The woman working the counter also told us that if we wanted to avoid paying for parking at Akaka falls to park outside the gate, so that was cool.
* Akaka Falls
   * Was surprised that they were charging people $10 for parking and $5 per person to enter the park. Goat lady told us to park outside the gate so we did, and only paid for entry to the park. There were two paths once you walk down the initial steps, one leading toward the left and about a 5 minute walk to the falls, and the other leading to the right and leading you on a 30 minute walk looping around to the falls. We did the right path, and ended up with a nice walk around.
* Scenic Drive
   * On our way back from the Goat Dairy and Akaka falls, we saw a sign for a scenic drive and detoured through it. Definitely recommend, it was very cool. Took us by the botanical gardens (which we didn't get a chance to stop at since they closed so early). Took us through what felt like straight up jungle at times.
* Volcanos National Park
   * Fat Tire E-Bike Tour - We took a tour (that I had seen someone recommend somewhere on this sub or the old sub) where we rode fat tire ebikes around the park. The tour description made it clear that all you had to be able to do was ride a bike, which I can, but I was terribly nervous leading up to it that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the group. It was made obvious in the first two minutes that I would have no problem keeping up as many people immediately fell over. Once we got going, this tour was great. My only feedback was that I wish there was more riding and fewer shopping trips (they took us by the commissary and by the official gift shop so people could get their souvenirs), but that was just because I had such a great time riding the bike!! The tour guides, Byron and Andres, were both great at answering questions and also provided binoculars for us to use.
   * Lava glow - We went back at night to see the lava glow. We parked at Devastation Trail head and followed the signs for lava glow, down a closed road. This was a very easy walk, and we got to the lava glow at about 9:15. When we first arrived, the viewing area was packed and I was a little disappointed, but after about 5 minutes the entire area seemed to clear. We got talking with another couple there and spent about an hour chatting with them while watching the lava bubble and watching the stars, which was pretty great. While we were there, an older woman came down and did a (I assume) traditional chant and prayer, which was pretty cool to watch. I highly recommend going later at night so you don't have to fight the crowds!
* Shark Farms Vanilla, Coffee, and Cacao Farm Tour
   * We found this tour on AirBnB experiences while we were staying in Hilo and decided to do it instead of heading to the gardens or the zoo. A little weird when we first showed up, but ended up being our best farm tour experience. Shark makes his own coffee, vanilla, and chocolate, as well as growing the plant of all 3. He and his wife set out quite a spread of food and things to taste while we waited for everyone to show up, and also had a lot of books and literature for people to peruse while they wait. Shark told us every detail about every process, from fertilizing the vanilla beans, to identifying different coffee bean parasites, to even letting us try things at different stages of the process (like freshly opened Cacao, which he picked off a tree and opened while we were all together, then passed around). We also got to see chocolate in all stages of being made, as well as got to use liquid chocolate that was ready to put into molds to make our own with mac nuts in them. So much fun! Afterwards, more snacks and treats while the chocolate cured. Shark and his assistant, Shannon, as well as Shark's life, Ana, were all so incredibly kind. Shark showed us the AirBnB that he and his wife have on their property as well and I wish we had known about it before because it looked so peaceful and amazing.
* Rainbow Falls
   * Rainbow Falls was nice, definitely no hiking at all. Park, walk like 200 feet, and then see the falls. Pretty.
* Hawaiian Vanilla Company - Vanilla Experience Luncheon and Farm Tour
   * This was a really interesting experience. We got up there and were ushered into a pretty little greenhouse space for drinks and a meal, where every component of the dishes had vanilla (even our drinks!). We then walked down to one of their vanilla fields (if that's the right term?) and the son of the man who started the farm talked a lot about how they grow vanilla. Then walk back up for ice cream and coffee, as well as an explanation of how vanilla is made, which they encourage you do and provide ""starter kits"" with three vanilla beans in a jar. All in all a pretty cool experience, and if we hadn't been to Shark's farm tour the day before it would have been all new information for us.

Restaurants:

* Ken's House of Pancakes
   * Yummy. Got a Banana Macnut waffle. Major diner vibes, but it was fun. I was sure we were going to have a 40 minute wait but it was only 10 minutes. I wanted to go back here at midnight when we got back from the lava viewing since they are 24 hours but couldn't convince my husband to go for it, haha.
* Pesto Cafe
   * Got shrimp on wonton crisps, some cheesy bread, kalamari, and an artichoke pizza. The pizza was amazing, my husband and I love artichokes so it was great for us.
* Two Ladies Kitchen
   * Stood in line for 40 minutes for them to be out, but taking orders. No problem, set an order for pick up the next morning for like 25 mochis. Easy peasy the next morning, grabbed the mochi and were on our way. My ONLY regret was that I wish I had ordered a couple different mochi each day instead of a bulk order, as they definitely were INCREDIBLE freshly made and slowly got hard in the refrigerator :(
* Moon and Turtle
   * My favorite restaurant on the Hilo side. Got some Brussel sprouts and the cheesiest noodles I've ever eaten in my life, a beef pasta dish, and a risotto. I wanted to go back here at the end of the trip but it was too far of a drive from Kona to justify it :( Seriously amazing experience.
* Ola Brew
   * Stopped here on a whim. We got and tried all 4 of the different bao's they had as well as a pork appetizer. The pork appetizer was good but was way too much food and we didn't finish it.
* Hilo Bay Cafe
   * The food was okay, but the view was where it was at. We got an awesome seat, but unfortunately it rained all afternoon/evening and eventually the wind picked up and we started getting rained on. If it had been clear, we would have had the best seat in the house.
* Tex Drive In
   * DELICIOUS malasadas!! So glad we stopped and got these. We got one of each of the flavors, tried some there, and then split the rest the next morning (warmed up great with a wet paper towel over the top on low power in the microwave).

&#x200B;

**South Side**

* Punalu'u Bake Shop
   * Honestly, pass on this. We showed up and instantly it felt like a major tourist trap. Waited in line for food, then at the front of the line one of the workers behind the counter dropped something and it splashed brown liquid all over my white clothes. Couldn't leave line because I had already waited 30 minutes. Stepped up to order and asked the woman working the counter for a warm wet paper towel to try to clean up. she offered me a dry one, and I asked if she could wet it. She did, then came back and asked what we wanted (never any apology for the explosion of mysterious liquid all over me). We had planned to split the special but as she was wetting the paper towel a different woman pulled down the sign with the special on it and started erasing. We asked if they had run out and the woman running the cashier said ""no, it was just wrong"" (weird, it was 12:30? it had been wrong all day? but whatever). We weren't interested in splitting the new special so instead ordered a cup of soup that was their special, a chowder, along with some malasadas. While my husband waited for food I went into the bathroom to clean my clothes. I finished 15 minutes later and came out and he was still waiting for the soup. We were a little surprised that we had to wait so long for them to scoop a bowl of soup, but I took the malasadas and found a seat far away from the madness that was the inside. A couple minutes later my husband walked over and said they had told him they had run out of that soup and were refunding him. We took our malasadas and left. The malasadas were okay, and I thought maybe malasadas just weren't my jam, but after trying Tex's I knew that Punalu'u Bake Shop's malasadas were just vastly inferior. Major pass on this one.
* Punalu'u Black Sand Beach
   * The black sand beach was definitely cool. I've never seen anything like it before, so it was fun to explore. There was a high surf warning when we went, so we didn't get in the water, but took lots of pics and spent some time hanging out.
* Miranda's Farms Coffee Shop
   * Stopped here on a whim driving by. Yummy coffee and delicious cookies, with a cute little front patio to sit and eat!

&#x200B;

**North Side**

Many of the locations I grouped under Kona could also be grouped in the north side of the island, I have noted these with an asterisks.

* Waipi'o Valley Lookout
   * Even though Waipi'o valley is closed, the lookout was a great chance to see the valley. It was gorgeous and you could see a little farm in the valley that looked straight out of Harvest Moon.
* Drive up to Pololu Valley
   * Honestly the drive up to Pololu was one of the coolest places we drove around. Trees were literally growing sideways due to the wind, it looked like I was in a Dr Seuss book. Once on top of the ridge, it was incredibly windy, and meanwhile we were passing a ton of different cacti (which was shocking?) and some huge pastures. We ended up coming back here after going to Pololu and before Merriman's to watch the sunset at the pull off area high up on the mountain.
* Pololu Valley
   * Like Waipi'o, beautiful, but you can hike down to it. We didn't end up hiking down it because we wanted to go back and watch the sunset, but some people coming up said it was a very cool hike :)
* Merriman's
   * I was very hyped for Merriman's and it was great, but we had our second Canoe House trip the next day so it ended up getting a little overshadowed. We don't drink, and their non-alcoholic drinks were amazing. I got the lamb, which was great (but the lamb my husband got at Canoe House was even better, and he claimed it was the best lamb he had ever eaten) and my husband got a steak. Dessert was also pretty yummy, I got the bread pudding and he got the lava cake.

1695966323.0,Is the big island worth it?,"I really want to go to Hawaii in mid-may of 2024, I recently joined this community to try to find more information about Hawaii overall. 
I have been thinking about going to the big island because I saw that it is a good place to go stargazing and farmers markets. But I recently saw a response to a post on this reddit page saying that the big island isn't worth it due to having sucky food and homeless people everywhere... is that really the case?

Edit: sorry if this post comes across as mean or insensitive, this wasn't my intention. This will be one of my first big travels and wanted to know if people felt safe, because I didn't even think about the possible crime or anything (my ignorance). I also just wanted to ask if some people thought that other Islands were more fun or had better activities. I really am interested in going to the big island but I have been doing a bunch of research and I just want to get real people's opinions on where they liked when they went.",VisitingHawaii

1664841836.0,Trip Report - Kauai,"Kauai Trip Report

We had a great trip to Kauai and made even better by some of the suggestions of this sub. So I thought I would pay it forward with a trip report. We were there Friday-to-the-following-Monday, split between Poipu and Princeville. This trip was a young-at-heart couple without kids in mid-September.  

**Some general observations** - Dinner was hard. Most things closed by 8 if not earlier and dinner places seemed to be mostly aimed at tourists with mediocre food or fine dining. If you want to watch the sunset (which was at 6:30), getting dinner after was always a challenge. The best real local places mostly served breakfast and lunch.  

The scenery in the north was amazing, but the food in the south was better with more options and less geared to tourists if you knew where to look and Lihue wasn't so far that you couldn't go there.  

Everything takes longer and business hours are let's say... flexible. Things were randomly closed when they should have been open (even the sign on the door suggested they should be open). Staffing issues are clearly a problem. Double check the days of the week when something should be open as well as the hours. If you aren't from a similar climate, the heat and humidity really drain you and you just do everything slower.  

Target and Costco are near the airport, I suggest going there first and stocking up on supplies. Sunscreen is surprisingly about the same price as the mainland in most chain stores.  

If you are renting a car, sign up for their program and add your number to your rental. You will skip most of the line. The regular line was at least an hour, the ""VIP"" line or whatever was a lot shorter. As far as I know, you must go through a line, there is no just pick up car.  

If you have been to the Caribbean or are a SCUBA diver, you probably won't find the snorkeling very impressive. The coral isn't very nice and only in one spot (Tunnels) did I find the snorkeling worth while.  

Based on a suggestion from here, we did the Shaka guide (tip, if you sign up without buying, they will send you coupon codes for a few days). I am glad we did, it was a little cheesy, but definitely heard some stories and context we wouldn't have otherwise.  

I will say, staying in Princeville, I felt a bit bad staying in an Airbnb. I know housing is a huge issue on the island and this neighborhood would be a normal suburban neighborhood anywhere else in the US, but instead a boring 2 br condo is $4K a week. I really hated that, for the most part, this was a rental vacation neighborhood instead for being for local families. I also hated how much wasted space the golf course took up. 

Things I wish we had time for: More snorkeling. Seeing Hanapepe. Exploring Kapa'a.  

In Poipu, we stayed at the Marriott Koala Village. It was a fantastic hotel and an amazing pool. I loved being able to walk across the street and watch the ocean on the rocks. No swimming beach that is really walkable. We just went to Poipu Beach. The path along the water is very nice. 

**Activities**  
**Waimea canyon** - This was really nice. The view at the end is spectacular. When you get to the end of the park, go up the road to the right for an unobstructed view. IMO, worth the day trip. Note, that you have to pay for parking and park pass at the end and the canyon view. 

**Turtles at Poipu beach** - This was really cool. Every night around sunset turtles come up to the beach and rest. We were lucky and saw about 18-20 turtles. Someone told me about this, I hadn't read or heard about it otherwise. We also got to see some seals in the water.  

**Spouting hole** - It's cool. But I also live in the PNW where there is one we can get much closer to, so I wasn't overly impressed, but I can see how it's impressive for others.  


Tried snorkeling at Beach House, but the water was too rough, went to Poipu Beach and it was quite busy. Saw some fish, but really not that great.  

**Helicopter tour (doors off)** - It was very cool. The views were amazing. I didn't want to do a boat tour because I was concerned about sea sickness and several people we met said they got seasick from the boat, so I am glad I went with the helicopter. I felt perfectly safe, but our guide wasn't that great considering the price. You need to wear a long sleeve shirt for wind reasons, but it doesn't really get that cold. I would have expected a better guide.  

**Haena State Park** - I got very lucky and was able to get parking tickets for our day. I have to say, for the effort and cost of going, I didn't think it was worth it if you aren't going to do the full hike to the second beach. My partner and I got up to the 2nd viewpoint and it was very hot and sweaty. The snorkeling was better at Tunnels and it's a bit of a trek to just get to the beach. If you aren't going to do the full hike, I would say skip it and go to a beach that is easier to access like Hannalei Bay or Haena Beach. Just going for Ke'e beach isn't really worth it, especially if you need to ride the shuttle.  

**Tunnels** - This was by far the best snorkeling. Lots of different kinds of fish, I was lucky enough to see a couple of turtles and a ray. But the warnings about parking are real. There are about 10 parking spots and that's it. I went late in the day and got lucky there was one spot. Otherwise, you need to park at Haena Beach and walk along the beach. If you have 2 people, drop off your stuff and then have the driver park and walk back. I will say walking on the beach isn't easy in Hawaii, you seem to sink pretty far in. But if you are into snorkeling, this was my favorite spot of my trip.  

**Tubing** - This would be a cool thing in another place, but I don't think I would waste a day on it in Kauai. Basically go tube through canals and tunnels that were used to irrigate sugar cane fields. Communication of how the tour would work was really lacking (if you go, take water and phone/camera on the trip up to the start). I thought it was pricey for only being on the water for about an hour. I would have rather had another day at the beach or snorkeling.  

**Anini beach** - This was a great beach. Not as crowded as Hanalei Bay and had trees along the beach so you get some shade. The snorkeling was better than Poipu, but far out. Even though it's shallow, if you aren't comfortable swimming far out, I wouldn't recommend it for snorkeling.  

**Hannalei Bay** - beautiful beach. The water was a bit rough when I was there, but it seems if you go to one side or the other of the bay, the water is a little calmer. We had the problem of high tide being mid day basically every day we were on Kauai.  

If in the north, I recommend renting snorkel gear from Hannalei Surf Co. They were super nice and included defog with the rental. 

**Food**  
**Da Crack**(Poipu) - Decent Mexican food. One of the few places open past 8 that isn't a sit down restaurant.  

**Kukuiula fish hut** (in the market by Da Crack) it was really good poke.  

**Saenz Ohana Breakfast** (Princeville) - Good breakfast. Only open M-F.

**Bubba's Burgers** (Poipu, but there are multiple locations) - Solid burgers, good onion rings. A little put off by the sign that says they are short workers because people don't want to work. On Saturday, they stopped letting people in line around 7:10 because they close at 8.

**Waikomo shave ice** (same spot as Kukuila) - Best shave ice I had. Hours were unreliable though. Wailua is also really good shave ice, but I live in Portland where I can get that any time. I think Waikomo might be better than Wailua though.  

**Koala fish market** (Koala) - Good poke, I liked Lihue Poke Company better, both are good. Koala doesn't have any seating and know what you want to order before you get to the window. We walked back to the food cart pod up the road to sit.  

**Lihue Poke Company** (Lihue) - My favorite poke. 

**Lapperts** (Poipu) - Eh.. I don't think it was worth the hype. Probably the best ice cream on the island, probably not the best ice cream you have ever had. I did go to one on Oahu and the ice cream seemed better.  

**Anuenue Cafe**(Poipu) - Good breakfast - long lines, also unpredictable hours. They were closed on a day they should have been open without a sign or reason.  

**Sueoka Market** (Koala) - Great plate lunch and the best musubi according to my partner. Very reasonably priced.  

**Smiley Grinds** (Lihue) Good plate lunch, the gravy was delicious.  

**Pineapple in Paradise** - Dole whip food truck. Dole whip served in taiyaki. The Tayaki was really good.  

**Kilauea fish market** - the poke was fine but it was the worst rice I have ever had. It was over cooked and mushy. They sell out even though they close at 8, you want to get there by 6.  

**Kilauea Pizza** -  Meh, it was food... one of the few places open past 7.  

**Chicken in a Barrel** (Waimea) - Meh, it was food. We were starving after spending the day in Waimea canyon and it was about the only thing open in Waimea on a Sunday night. I would not recommend unless it's the only thing open.  

**Kalypso Grill** (Hanalei) - Eh... it was food. Not amazing. Severely understaffed. Again, one of the few places open for dinner.  

We also went to the Farmer's market in Hanalei Bay and Princeville on Saturday. They were mostly hand crafts and such and not so much farm. The produce was much more expensive than I was expecting. I will said I had the best mango of my life, even if it was $5. 

Overall a good trip. We got very lucky with the weather and basically had no rain. Everyone seems to have a favorite between north and south, but I honestly don't. I really liked both sides of the island for different reasons. If you have the time to split your time, I would recommend doing that. I hope my post can help someone planning their trip.  

And thank you to u/Hopeful-Cranberry for all their suggestions.",VisitingHawaii

LIKEKE FALLS

Type: Waterfall / Jungle

1 mi, 45min-1 hour

Highlights:
If you like lush tropical rainforest vibes, it doesn‚Äôt get much better than this. A short but pretty (and muddy) walk that leads to a hidden waterfall. 

PICTURE: https://imgur.com/a/QfKziYP

Difficulty:
Easy. It‚Äôs less than a mile round trip and doesn‚Äôt have significant elevation changes. The biggest challenge is finding the junction that leads to the falls, as it‚Äôs very easy to miss. There‚Äôs also mud and roots to contend with, as well as a few downed trees to step over. Suitable for all ages, not recommended for those who struggle with mobility.

NOTE: This review is if you hike from the golf course. Many people opt to hike from the Nu‚Äôuanu-Pali Overlook which adds a couple extra miles.

KULIOUOU VALLEY

Type: Forest

1.3 mi, 1-1.5 hours

Highlights: 
A quiet trail that feels surprisingly remote for how close to civilization it is. It‚Äôs a nice walk through a lush green forest, but nothing more. It ends sort of abruptly. If you‚Äôre expecting it to lead anywhere cool, you‚Äôll be disappointed. If you want some peace and quiet in nature, this is a perfect trail for that.

PICTURE: https://imgur.com/a/WcDAYjR

Difficulty: 
Easy. There‚Äôs a bit of ascent throughout, but it‚Äôs gradual. Suitable for all ages. Challenging but doable for someone struggling with mobility, not wheelchair accessible 

Crowd level: 
Low

_____________________

DIAMOND HEAD

Type: Unique Landmark / Views

2 mi, 1-2 hours

Highlights:
Arguably the most iconic landmark in Waikiki. Its full of history including bunkers, tunnels, stairs, and a lookout point. I enjoyed the exploration aspect of it. It feels almost more like a museum than a hike (in a good way). And you will not find a better view overlooking Honolulu.

NOTE: If you are not a resident of Hawaii, you will need to make a reservation in advance. 

PICTURE: https://imgur.com/a/hABpzxq

Difficulty: 
Mostly easy. Paved the entire way with a gradual incline throughout. There are also lots of stairs that add to the physical challenge. If you‚Äôre in good shape, it shouldn‚Äôt be that hard.

Crowd level: 
Extreme. It‚Äôs the most crowded hike in Oahu and gets very congested, especially closer to the top.  I will say I haven‚Äôt hiked it since the new reservation system went into effect, so I can‚Äôt speak to whether or not it helps to manage to crowd level.

PU‚ÄôU ‚ÄòOHI‚ÄôA TRAIL TO TANTALUS SUMMIT

Type: Forest / Mountain 

1 mi, 1-1.5 hours

Highlights: 
Tantalus is a volcano that sits overlooking Honolulu and is famous for its beautiful vegetation and large network of hiking trails. Pu‚Äôu  '≈åhi'a trail takes you all the way from the highest point the the road goes to the actual summit. The trail is beautiful. Mostly shaded with fairytale-esque vegetation and even a bamboo forest. Upon reaching the end of the trail, you can optionally continue along a paved path past some electrical towers to a small trail that takes you to the geographic summit.

PICTURE: https://imgur.com/a/SDMcXvb

Difficulty: 
Mostly easy. Well maintained but with a few steep stairs to climb up. Can get muddy during rainy season. Suitable for all ages. Not recommended for those who struggle with mobility.

Crowd level: 
Low. You‚Äôll probably pass a few other groups along the way.

______________________

KA'ENA POINT (WAIANAE SIDE)

Type: Shoreline 

5 mi, 2-4 hours

Highlights: 
Hike along Oahu‚Äôs last undeveloped coastline to a natural preserve for albatross and monk seals. The sharp lava rock makes lots of cool geographical formations including an arch and a blowhole. There‚Äôs also a good chance to see some wildlife and appreciate the views of the ocean and the Waianae mountains.

PICTURE: https://imgur.com/a/SYfXcwB

Difficulty:
Mostly easy. It‚Äôs a flat, wide path almost the entire way. The main challenge is the length (5 miles round trip) and the heat. The heat on the west side gets BRUTAL and there‚Äôs no shade to protect from the sun. Bring sunscreen and lots of extra water. Suitable for all ages, challenging but doable for those struggling with mobility. Not wheelchair accessible.

Crowd level: 
Moderate

________________________

LAIE FALLS 

Type: Forest / Waterfall 

7.5 mi, 3-5 hours

Highlights: 
This long but chill hike climbs up through rustic farmland, sunny mountain ridges, pine groves, and guava trees before reaching a junction in the trail. Turn right to climb down into a gully with a stream and 2-tiered waterfall. It‚Äôs even swimmable if you‚Äôre willing to risk leptospirosis.

PICTURE: https://imgur.com/a/wyYndE3

Difficulty: 
Moderate and lengthy. The trail itself isn‚Äôt too steep but it is constantly ascending. There are a few stretches with no shade, so bring extra water and sun protection. Descending to the falls is the hardest part. It‚Äôs steep, very slippery, and has some tricky footing. There‚Äôs ropes to help. Suitable for hikers of all experience levels and average fitness. Not recommended for children under 7 without previous hiking experience.

NOTE: This hike requires a permit to access. Here is a link: https://www.hrihelp.com/_files/ugd/d737f5_820e2bd9947d4e07a60943b1e9d7c10d.pdf

**Reddit breaks when I try to post the rest of this, so it‚Äôs continued in the comments**",VisitingHawaii
1654537749.0,"Just back from 6 nights in Oahu, what I liked and didn't like","Things I loved:

**Our hotel, Hyatt Regency**, was really great.  Great views, great service, great value. We splurged for a first time, so it was worth it.  Before hand I worried if it wasn't special enough, should I go all out and get one of the top hotels...but this was perfect for us! (38th floor!) We also had club access which gave us free breakfast and hors d'oeuvres which were both hot and amazing. 

**Hanauma Bay**\-My god, what a special place!  I was so worried for 2 reasons: 1) Booking reservations.  You really do need to book right at 7am.  We had computer and phone ready and found the phone was much better!  Got the time and date we wanted no problem.  Again, be ready at 7am. 2) Parking!  I was arriving on time but not early and heard about parking filling up.  We arrive and they have the ""lot Closed"" sign up and I gulp.  But the guys there ask when your reservation is and they let you in if you don't have much time left.  All worked out!  So many great fish and coral to see!  A must!

**Adela's country eatery**\- What amazing noodles and friendly people!  If in the area I highly suggest!  They give you a ton of food so the price (basically $20) per is not too bad.  We took it to a nearby neighborhood with amazing views of the  mountain and put the top down and had a wonderful picnic!

**Experience at Nutridge luau**\-Another amazing experience!  The setting was gorgeous and we learnd os much about local culture while also being greatly entertained!  

**Turtle Bay**\-We had plans to drive the north shore to find a place to go snorkeling for the day.  Stopped at a few along the way but the bathroom situation was disgusting.  Finally headed up to turtle bay and had the best of both worlds!  Probably not the top snorkeling place but it was good enough.  Being surrounded by a resort meant top quality restrooms and options too.

**Fumi's Shrimp**\-Not the truck but the fixed location.  Stopped here because I thought I remembered reading that it was just as good (if not better) than Giovanni's.  Well I can't speak to that but mi's was excellent!  Got the spicy garlic and loved it

**Golden Pork Ramen**\-Had reservations elsewhere but were cancelled so we headed here as I knew they didn't take reservations.  Had to only wait 10mins.  Definitely a local joint, very few tourists.  The ramen was so amazing!  Mine was the vegan black garlic and both I and my were shocked how flavorful it was!  It was priced right as well! I wanted to go back but ran out of time! Was a little worried about parking nearby with many homeless camped in the park across the street but all worked out.

**Azure restaurant**\-Had reservations for the first night and it was such a great evening!  The setting (On the beach), the elegant hotel (Royal Hawaiian) and the amazing experience of having a fixed menu by an allstar chef.  Everything was so unique and flavorful.  Loved the experience!

What I didn't like:

Not much...but...

**Byodo-In Temple**\- I had this from Trip advisor and didn't do much research.  It's a real Japanese Buddhist temple and I felt it was more for serious Buddhists than tourists.  Yes plenty of tourists but it seemed odd to me.  The grounds are small, what you see is not much and the temple itself is like a real church.  I'm not religious and I didn't enjoy it.  

**Leonard's**\-Tough call here.  Felt nice being able to experience it, but I wouldn't go back and thus I put it here.  Yes they are served hot, but they are way over sugared and just ok.  

**Kailua Beach**\-Again, it doesn't feel right putting here BUT I had heard so much about this stretch of beaches so I felt it was a must see.  It really didn't feel special to me.  Nice park by it so you get some grass...and there is some tree coverage...but it was still crowded and not some quiet, secret place.  So not sure what I was to expect. I wouldn't goo out of my way just to go there. All of Oahu is beautiful, in fact we passed maybe 5 beach stretches on the way there that seemed as good!

**Hell's itch-**I am a dummy!  After having a severe sunburn twice in my life and knowing Hell's itch, I did it yet again.  Why? Because I forgot when snorkeling your back faces up and so you better reapply 5 times!  I did once and suffered, luckily it was our last day so I am suffering at home instead of there!

Finally, what surprised me:

**Waikiki**

As someone who hates touristy places, I often try to avoid them...but some you have to try once in your life.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't hate Waikiki!  It's for tourists but at least they keep it orderly.  Some tourist locations around the world are a mess with street peddlers etc that ruin the atmosphere.  Waikiki has some of that at night but not much.  I look forward to going back!",VisitingHawaii
1684867519.0,Oahu Review,"Hi all!  
I just finished the most magical week in Oahu and wanted to share my experience because I know when booking I used a lot of different Reddit reviews. I‚Äôm gonna break it up by the hotel, food, and activities. I hope that this will help someone when deciding what activities or food to eat in Oahu like others helped me!  
For some background I‚Äôm 26(f) and went with my partner who is 25(m). We traveled from JFK to HNL via direct 11 hour flight and stayed for seven nights and eight days.  


Hotel:  
We decided to stay at Hilton Hawaiian village in Waikiki and were roomed in the Tapas tower. We had a partial ocean view. The room itself was spacious, updated, and nice for two people. The room contained a small mini fridge.  
**Pros**  
\-Good location  
\- friendly staff and clean facility  
\- beach access  
\-alot of on resort food if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into (we personally always went off the resort)  


**Cons**  
\-no adult only pool or hot tub, the facility only had one hot tub and it was always full of children 10 and under. The pools were often full of unsupervised children horse playing as well.  
\-the pool closes at 6 except for the tapas pool,but this pool then becomes overcrowded and full of children.  
\- no chairs by the pool ever, people go to the pool early and claim there chairs with towels. So unless you get up early don‚Äôt count on getting a chair.  
\-no microwave (I know most resorts are like this but a microwave would be nice)  
\-and then finally the biggest con ever, parking is 64$ per DAY. Valet is even more.we personally could not afford this so with a quick google search we learned that we could park for free in the day on the harbor/lagoon a block from the hotel and then at night we parked in the paid lot next to the free parking. This lot was 1$ per hour and had a max 24 hour stay. This ended up totaling us 12/13$ per evening which is substantial savings when compared to the whopping 64$ per day.  


All in all it‚Äôs a nice resort but as a younger couple I feel we would‚Äôve enjoyed an adults only resort more.  


**FOOD**  
*im gonna rate each out of 5 with 5 being the best and 0 being the worst*  
Dukes Waikiki 4/5  
\-Dukes is pretty much the king of touristy restaurants in Oahu. That being said if you can look past the extreme heat in the waiting area, as well as the loud chatter, the food is pretty dynamite and the hula pie was the best dessert we had on our trip. We went back a second time just for the hula pie. (Also side note: this is where I was proposed to on our trip)  
\-the service was awesome and fast as well.  


Cafe kaila 5/5  
\-best breakfast on the trip  
\-French toast and iced latte were amazing  


Monkeypod in Ko Olina 4/5  
\-my boyfriend said this was the best place we went on the WHOLE trip and he ordered the fish sandwich.  
\-I beg to differ though, I ordered a ramen dish and it was just okay.  
\-they use fresh ingredients which is cool and locally sourced items  
\-had a good cocktail AND mocktail menu.  
\-it allowed us to venture to the west side of the island for a night and see something different.  


Maguro Spot 5/5  
\-hands down the best poke I‚Äôve ever had in my life.  
\-it was also super affordable which is cool.  
\-had a build your own option  


Paia 4/5  
\-fresh seafood  
‚ÅÉ the fish tacos were amazing and I thought the seafood pasta was also amazing.  
‚ÅÉ Also affordable  


Liliha Bakery 3/5  
\-I wasn‚Äôt crazy about this one, the food was okay.  
\-the pastries were also okay  
\-I kind of regret not going to Leonard‚Äôs instead.  


Surf and Salsa 5/5  
\-food truck on the north shore  
\-a hidden gem  
\-the Al pastor tacos were to die for and the burrito was huge.  


Lanikai Juice 5/5  
\-we both got a√ßa√≠ bowls and even went here twice.  
\-awesome variety of toppings and juices/smoothies  
\-perfect after diamond head brunch  


Rise and grind coffee in Kailua 5/5  
\-cute lil coffee shop w back patio  
\-coffee was amazing and the breakfast food was also good.  
\-affordable breakfast  


Morning Glass Cafe 3/5  
\-So I truly came here because it was gassed up by almost everyone on Reddit  
\-we arrived 30 minutes early before opening and sat in the car til we saw a line forming and jumped in the line.  
\-they had a unique menu and I got the mac n cheese pancakes which were awesome.  
\-but I didn‚Äôt think the coffee was all it cracked up to be and the menu was limited as far as breakfast options go.  


Eggs n things 5/5  
\-good amount of food for 12.50$ per person  
\-quick service  
\-everyone was super nice  


**Activities**  
So I researched a ton of things before I left and narrowed it down to the few things that we did, and I can honestly say that everything we did was worth the time and money.  


Diamond head 4/5  
\-a must  
\-gave really scenic views  
\-be prepared for a steep hike up many stairs though  
\-I gave a 4/5 because my fianc√© didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much.  


Kailua Beach Adventures 5/5  
\-we rented a tandem kayak from here for half a day (four hours).  
\-boy was kayaking way more challenging than I expected lol.  
\-it was a great workout and an awesome experience.  
\-the facility provides you different route options, the one we chose to do was the 2 mile journey to Mokulua Island. This is one they labeled as an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù route and I can definitely see why. It started raining half way through our journey and the water was choppy making it more difficult. But the end result was amazing.  
\-we saw a monk seal resting on the rocks which was super cool and the queens bath is also on this island (a little tide pool thing)  
\-the island is also a nesting habitat for a certain species of birds so it was cool to see their natural habitat.  
\-other routes suggested by the facility include the canals, lanikai beach, and a smaller island that was closer that had tide pools.  
\-staff was super nice and helpful as well.  


Snorkeling at Hanauma bay 5/5  
\-a magical experience truly  
\-we saw sooo many beautiful tropical fishes and so many coral reefs, it was breath taking and worth the sunburnt back.  
\-we even saw a parrot fish crunching on rocks and a staff member told us that parrot fish accidentally eat rocks, have grinders in their throat that grind the rock to sand, and they poop sand out. She told us they poop 600-800lbs of sand per year.  
\-the only complaint I have is that you have to get on at 7am two days before you want to go in order to get tickets, they sell out rather quickly and I can see why.  
\-this is probably the cheapest snorkeling option on the island aside from buying snorkeling gear from Walmart and doing it yourself.  
\-rentals cost roughly 40$ for flippers and masks for two people.  


Turtle beach and Sunset beach on the north shore 5/5  
\-easily our favorite activity.  
\-we went two days to the turtle beach  
\-we saw so many turtles swimming in the ocean and washing up a shore.  
\-there were also nests where the turtles laid their eggs.  
\-also swimming in the north shore I felt was significantly better than the beaches of Waikiki.  
\-we also walked around the shops of the north shore which was a nice rainy day activity.  


Dole Plantation 3.5/5  
\-good for what it was  
\-probably a good activity if you have kids  
\-we just did the walk through garden tour  
\-I almost missed the pineapples as in the garden walk through tour there‚Äôs only like 8 pineapples growing.  
\-I honestly really only went for the dole whip and it was amazing. The pineapple juice tasted like alcohol though.  


I hope this review helps someone else plan their trip and narrow down options :)

1658515364.0,6 Days Kauai Trip Report (early July),"This sub and r/hawaiivisitors were very helpful to me in planning my Hawaii trip, so I figured I would pay it forward by posting my trip report for my 6 day Kauai trip. Instead of doing a day-by-day itinerary, I'll just talk about the various aspects of the trip (accomodation, attactions/excursions/food, etc.).

***HIGHLIGHTS***

Overall, it was an amazing trip, my personal highlights were the Hanakapiai Falls trail (make sure to get your tickets early!!) and learning to surf on Kiahuna beach (I felt a little silly being in the beginner surf zone with all the kids, but had lots of fun!).¬† Favourite food spots were Ishihara Market (the best poke I had in Kauai) and Pono Market (the Kalua pig was amazing).

***THINGS TO WATCH FOR***

* One thing I didn't quite realize was how car centric the island was. I've previously¬†usually visited Europe for vacations, so I'm used to being able to walk around town. But in Kauai, you couldn't get anywhere without a car. E.g. from Poipu where I was staying, it was very hard to find any food options that didn't require driving (except for expensive resort food). Even when something was within walking distance, there were no sidewalks and you had to walk/cycle on the shoulder of the road, which felt unsafe at times. Also, I'm a city slicker, so not really used to  rural roads after dark, and driving from Lihue to Poipu after nightfall the first day was VERY uncomfortable, especially when it started raining and especially with all the highbeams from oncoming traffic. Lastly, parking was a huge pain at the popular attractions (e.g. Waimea Canyon park, Queens Bath, Haena beach).
* Things close really early (I recall that most fish markets closed in the early afternoon or didn't open on weekends), and some attractions had odd hours. This sometimes made trip planning annoying, e.g. if you are planning a day trip to the north and want to visit Kilauea lighthouse, you'd have to go on Thur/Fri/Sat, which might not be possible if you've already booked other excursions on those days.
* Things are really expensive, especially with tips. It's the same thing in Toronto, but I find it annoying how even when you do take out¬†the terminal prompts you to tip 15-18% minimum.

***ACTIVITIES / SITES***

My favourite activities were the hikes, from my favourite to least favourite, they were:

1. **Hanakapiai Falls / Kalalau trail** \- hands down the best trail I did, you get a beautiful view of the Na Pali coast, plus the falls is much better imo than secret falls. If I had enough time, I would want to do the full Kalalau trail instead. Remember to book early and bring plenty of water (I'm used to hiking in Canada and only brought \~1.5L, but the heat killed me and I should have brought the recommended 2-2.5L).¬†
2. **Waimea Canyon** trail to Waipoo falls - Waimea Canyon and Kokee¬†Park were also great, the canyon was beautiful. Though parking at the place where you buy tickets ($10/car¬†+$5/person) was a pain, so was parking at the trailhead. I only had time to do this the trail to Waipoo falls, it was really good for the view of the canyon, but for some reason my trail map (Alltrails) didn't actually lead me to the falls, only the ""mini falls"", which I didn't realize ahead of time. There are also tons of look outs along the route 550, definitely recommend hitting up as many as possible.
3. **Sleeping Giant East Trail** \- fun quick hike up and down and you get a good view of the island, but not as great as the other trails on the list
4. **Secret (Uluwehi) Falls** Kayak + Hike - the trail itself was ok, but it was super crowded with tour groups when I went (\~9AM in the morning). The kayaking trip was eh - fern grotto route was closed when I went, and you had to share the river with barges etc.¬† Edit to add: I forgot to mention, I didn't do the tour group, but rented a kayak from **Kayak Kauai**. The staff there was super nice, but be aware that if you are doing the rental, you have to car top your kayak (which can be a little tricky, especially since you're trying to not scratch your rental car) and then drive it literally 500m away to the other side of the river to launch due to some rule about the number of kayaks they can launch from the marina or something (if you're doing group tour you don't have to worry about that).
5. **Mahaulepu Trail (+Makauwehi caves)** \- I found the trail super hard to follow as there were a ton of unmarked detours. Part of the trail is also on a golf course. I did see a seal at Gillan beach, which was nice. Next time I would just stop at **Shipwreck beach** and call it a day.

**Captain Andy's cave raft tour** \- Overall pretty good, great to be able to go into the caves, but it was a long ride from Waimea to Na Pali. Next time I'd probably opt for the heli tour instead, or if I were to do the raft, I'd also do the snorkeling package.

**Surfing at Hoku Watersport** \- I talked about this above, it was mostly kids taking classes at Kiahuna beach when I went, but it was still really fun and beginner friendly.

Other things we did included snorkeling (Poipu and Lydgate), **Kilauea Lighthouse**, **Wailua Falls** (personally I thought it was not really worth the drive), Hanalei Pier. One thing I really wanted to do but missed out on was **Queens Bath**, but I got there pretty late in the day, and it was impossible to find parking (there are like 5 spots at the trailhead).

***FOOD***

My favourite food on the island were all the poke options. Favourite was **Ishihara Market** (unfortunate it was so out of the way, otherwise I definitely would have gone back for more) and **Pono Market**, but we also tried **Kilauea Fish Market**, **Koloa Fish Market**, and **Konohiki seafood**, which were still very good and better/fresher than poke I could find in Toronto

For shave ice, I only had time to do **Jojo's** and **Waikomo** \- I probably enjoyed Jojo's more myself (it was also larger/cheaper), but Waikomo used more natural flavouring if you're into that.

Only sit down restaurants we went to were **Kiawe Roots** and **Rumfire Poipu**, both were really good for¬†fish dishes, but I thought the non-fish dishes at both spots were comparable to what you could get elsewhere, so you‚Äôre probably not missing out if you skipped those.¬†

Some other places:

* **L&L Hawaiian BBQ** \- nothing wrong with it, but you could do better than fairly generic fast food for the same price. Their pork lau lau was not as good as what I got from Pono (which was really good, I particularly enjoyed the tates of the leaves), and I didn't really get the appeal of loco moco (felt like a fancier salisbury steak) or musubi (literally spam¬†+ sushi rice¬†+ nori that you could make at home).
* **Hamura Saimin** \- stopped by here on the way to the airport, it was pretty good, but I would have been happier with another poke bowl myself
* **Da Crack** \- it was ok, but I've had better burritos at home.
* **Savage Shrimp** \- overpriced what what it was imo.

&#x200B;

Other restaurants that was on my list but I didn't get a chance to visit were **Keoki's Paradise** (I did not realize this place booked out weeks ahead of time), **Fish Express**, and **Mark's Place**.

***TRAVEL (TO / FROM CANADA) + CAR RENTAL***

Probably the least interesting part of the trip, I'm just adding this for the benefit of any Canadian readers. My flight was at 6AM in the morning, and by 3AM, Pearson airport was completely packed. I got lucky and got through security quickly because I was with United, so didn't have to wait at the secondary Air Canada waiting area where they hold you before you're allowed to join the security line. The flight was otherwise uneventful. I know United doesn't have good reviews, but from what I could tell, still much better than the Air Canada experience at the moment.

My rental car reservation in Kauai was with **Alamo**. No issues there. Though I didn't realize there was a shuttle at Lihue airport that took you to the car rental location, so I walked from the gate the first time. My car was a compact. It was ok since I didn' do any off roading, but I would have preferred a jeep since there were several times where I had to park in a dirt parking lot or by the side of the road near a beach / park etc. where the higher clearance would have been helpful.

***ACCOMODATIONS (KO‚ÄôA KEA)***

I stayed the entire time at Ko'a Kea on Poipu beach. It's a ""boutique luxury"" hotel. I liked it since it was pretty quiet, mostly couples and retirees (the families with kids tended to stay at locations with nicer pools). I got a ""partial"" ocean view room, which meant I could see the ocean if I went on to the lanai, but otherwise not. It was really nice for a couples retreat (and a splurge for me), but it's not really worth it if you‚Äôre planning to drive around and be off the resort most days. I'd probably do a rental condo next time (the Kiahuna plantation resort next door seemed very nice, cheaper, and right on the water too).Couple of other things to note about the Ko‚Äôa Kea

* I would not stay here with kids, the pool¬†is tiny, and there's really not much to do at the resort itself for kids - they‚Äôd probably be happier at a bigger resort like Grand Hyatt, Koloa Landing, or Marriott Waiohai¬†
* the resort fronts onto the ocean, but there is a rocky outcrop right in front of it (you can see it on google maps). There's not really a ""beach"" right in front, you'd have to walk to Poipu beach or Kiahuna beach (the walkway to Kiahuna beach is also kind of sketch, but not a big deal). Location is otherwise awesome though, it was sunny every day in Poipu, and I loved being able to pop out early in the morning to see the turtles at Poipu beach.
* the ocean ""front"" rooms look amazing, but as far as I can tell, there is no huge difference between the ocean ""view"" rooms and the ""partial"" ocean view rooms. If staying here, I would either do partial ocean view (make sure you're on the 2nd or 3rd floor) or the ocean front if you can afford it
* there is only valet parking, which is kind of a pain when you just need to stop by to grab something at the resort. It's also expensive since you have to pay $25/night + tips for the valets whenever you pick up your car.

\-----

If you read all that, hope it helps! I (unsuccessfully) tried to keep it short, but there was so much to say! Overall I loved¬†Hawaii, and am already dreaming of my next trip (probably to Big Island next time).",VisitingHawaii
1664203336.0,Post trip: 7 days in Oahu with a packed itinerary,"We went to Oahu for 7 days, from 9/15/2022 to 9/22/2022.  Here was our planned itinerary:

https://imgur.com/ki1GagA

As you can see, we aren't ""relax on the beach"" type of people. We basically did the vast majority of our plan.  Notable exceptions:

-We skipped going out to breakfast on a few days, as we had leftovers from the night before

-We skipped Waimano Falls hike, and instead went to the 68th Annual Waikiki Ho'olaule'a Block Party (which was way too crowded, lines for food were ridiculous)

-We skipped Makapuu Tidepools

-We skipped Kayaking to the Mokes and Manoa Chocolate.  Instead we went bodyboarding at Queen's Beach.  Good choice, since we went kayaking two days before and had enough.

-A couple lunch spots we changed

**Here's what I would change next time:**
  
-Leonard's was nasty.  It was the only really bad food of the trip.  I had read online that other people say the same thing, but we had to try it for ourselves.  The inside just seemed really undercooked, like mushy raw dough.  Pipeline Bakery was way, way better.

-Kaneohe Sandbar kayak- it was neat and I'm glad I did it.  Saw two turtles.  Took us about 1.5 hours to get there, and an hour back.  First hour was fun, then it was just kinda exhausting/boring as the scenery doesn't really change. The day we went, the sandbar wasn't exposed so there really wasn't anything that cool about the destination.  Probably should have kayaked to the reefs and went snorkeling.  Or kayaked to the Mokes instead.

-Alicia's Market wasn't anything special.  The poke wasn't as fresh as other places, had a rubbery texture.  The roast pork was good, but not anything special.

-The lobster at Fat Cheeks wasn't great.  Overly salty, and a bit dry.  

**Things that I was very glad I did:**

-Hanauma Bay.  It really blew me away how many fish there were.  We saw thousands.  Big schools of hundreds of fish.  Having a boogie board was amazing, especially for my girlfriend who isn't a strong swimmer and cannot use a snorkel due to medical reasons.  Tickets were not hard to get, as long as you set your alarm (10am PST).  The slots go fast for round numbers (8am, 8:30am etc) but if you just pick 8:10am, or 8:40am you have way more time (10-20 minutes).  Parking wasn't an issue either, there was tons of parking when we got there at 8:30am, lot was maybe 1/3 full.  Wasn't crowded that day, so they were letting in anybody, regardless of your reservation time (we got there an hour early and they just let us in).  

-Ko Olina.  Not quite as good as Hanauma, but we also saw tons of fish, including big schools of fish.  You have to go closer to the barrier rocks.  Very little waves, kid friendly.  Also saw monk seals hanging out at the small beach just north of Lagoon 1, seems like that's there regular hang out spot.  Tons of free parking when we got there 8:15am, seemed like it didn't really fill up until about 9:30am.

-Frankie's Nursery.  We like trying new foods, and there were lots of fruit we've never even heard about.  We bought 4 fruits, came out to $5, so very reasonable.  Our favorite fruit was ""abiu""

-Lyon Arboretum and Ho'omaluhia Botanical gardens.  Both are free (Lyon you need reservations and they request a donation of $5/each).  Both are easy walks, with gorgeous plants.  The botanical gardens has some incredible scenic views.  Can park for free at Lyon, then walk to Manoa Falls to save on their parking fee.

-Likeke Falls hike.  Wasn't on our agenda, but we fit it in before Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden.  Its a great short hike, took maybe 40 minutes round trip.  A little muddy in some spots, but not too bad.  We parked at the Ko'olau Golf Club ($10), others parked on the street for free.  

-ATV ride.  Had a great time.  They tell you to arrive 45 minutes early, we got there about 25 minutes early and that was just in time.  You have to get tickets, sign paperwork, and watch a small presentation, and they leave right on time.  Its a little dusty, but I was able to just use sunglasses instead of the provided goggles.  A benefit of getting there earlier is getting assigned a more forward ATV, closer to the guide, so there's less dust.

-Car rental.  We were debating it, but it ended up being crucial for us.  Public transportation or uber would not have cut it at all.  Traffic wasn't bad at all, just a tiny bit around Waikiki, finding parking was never an issue.  We used Turo, cost was roughly $100/day after insurance.  We stayed near Waikiki Banyan Parking, which charges $150/week, which to us was worth it.

-Airbnb.  After various fees, it came out to about $100/night.  Ours provided bodyboards, snorkels, beach chairs, umbrellas, etc.  Had a kitchen too.  Located 2 blocks from Waikiki (Prince Edward Street).  Felt like such a better value than $400+/night at the resorts.

Other notes:

-Maguro Bros line wasn't nearly as bad as I read online.  We went at about 6:45pm, there were about 20 people in line but it moves at a reasonable pace.  Took about 20 minutes to get our food.  

-Sunset cruise, we saw 4-5 turtles.  If you get motion sickness, bring dramamine or ginger chews, and focus on the horizon or a point in the distance.  We ate ginger chews the whole cruise.

-Its much more fun to walk around Honolulu in the evenings. 

-Pali lookout parking is $7, but the parking is right next to the lookout...so you can either just run to the lookout and take a quick photo, or keep someone in the car and rotate.  

-If you go to Adela's Country Eatery, call your order in ahead of time.  Saves tons of time.

-Lava tube near Halona Blowhole was fun to explore, but be aware there's a bit of garbage inside and cockroaches.


I loved the food, I might make a separate post with food pics and reviews.",VisitingHawaii
1663782532.0,Thank you to whoever returned my wallet to the police station! üôè,"From the Bay Area and lost my wallet the first night in Waikiki on 9/15, it probably slipped out of my pocket as I was moving my luggage to my rental. I didn't even think about calling the police as I didn't have any faith in humanity lol.

The night I was about to leave on 9/19, I called the police station to get some paperwork so I can get through TSA since my ID was in my wallet, they looked me up and said my wallet was at the station! Apparently it was turned in ~2 hours after when I think I lost it!

Went to the station the next morning to pick it up. All my cash was gone but everything else was still there, including my ID, so I was able to fly back home smoothly. I assume someone found my wallet, took the cash, tossed it, and someone else returned to the station. So whoever did that, thank you so much! I should've called the station earlier!",VisitingHawaii
1651777973.0,Considerations when using Airbnb,"For those of you that use the Airbnb, please keep in mind that if your renting an entire apartment that you could be directly effecting a local persons chances of having a home. Since the pandemic has waned and tourism has ramped back up. People have sold off a lot of their homes and rental properties and these new owners instead of keeping them as long term rentals they‚Äôve decided to turn them to airbnbs for a hefty profit. Causing more distress to already scarce housing market and causing local people to move or even live out with of their cars. I and everyone in my building has been told our leases are not being renewed and as people leave the apartments are being converted to airbnbs. Which is also illegal in a lot of places in the state. And before the internet decides to go off on me, yes I have been contacting the local housing authorities, I‚Äôm compiling a case but little can be done. 
I‚Äôm just offering a friendly reminder that the impacts of tourism is not always kind. And maybe to consider your options when deciding on how to best enjoy your stay in these beautiful islands. Thank you for your time and consideration.",VisitingHawaii

1692467456.0,8 day trip report for O‚Äôahu,"My fianc√© and I travelled to O‚Äôahu last week for our first visit. The trip was planned around one of our best friends getting married. 

I got a lot of recommendations and feedback from this subreddit that I am thankful for so here‚Äôs the report!

Day 1:
-  landed in Honolulu at 1pm
- picked up rental car and drove to hotel. We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki for the first 2 nights.  
- wedding party attended a Luau together. We did the Queens Luau. It was really fun, food was good, but the location was a little odd. It was in the mall but I will say it makes it super convenient when staying in Waikiki. 

Day 2: 
- woke up and went to breakfast at Hula Grill. The view was amazing and the food was phenomenal. It was recommended to us from a friend & recommended the banana Mac pancakes and they were so so good. 
-  Ka‚Äôena point (the north side of the hike). This was a big recommendation I found on Reddit and from zookeepers as it was a more quiet part of Ka‚Äôena point and the more likely place to spot monk seals. And we found 3! I really wanted to see monk seals on our trip and was ecstatic that we found them on our second day. 
- went to 7/11 to try the spam misubi and y‚Äôall I was skeptical but I wanted to try it and omg it was so good! 
- bachelorette and bachelor parties we were to attend. 
- I went out on a catamaran with the bridal party. We went with Mai Tai Catamarans and omg it was a blast. The crew was awesome and the Mai tais were yummy. I can‚Äôt say what the guys did except bar hop, but my fianc√© had a great time! 
- we then had dinner reservations at Johnny Bahamas and I was really disappointed with the food. But that may have just been my fault, the sauce that was on my mahi mahi tasted like cilantro and I‚Äôm soooo sensitive to cilantro. I just could not eat it. Everyone else loved their meal though so could‚Äôve just been bad luck on my end. 

Day 3: 
- grabbed a quick lunch from the hotel restaurant as we had a food credit and hit the road for the day! We were heading to the North Shore to stay at a wedding villa for the next few days. 
-  stopped at Tradition Coffee Roasters for some caffeine. I enjoyed this caf√©! The coffee was good and the eco-friendly cups were awesome. 
- Ho ªomaluhia Botanical Garden because of a recommendation on this subreddit! The views were stunning and it was free. Would recommend. 
- Kualoa Ranch for our Jungle Expedition Tour. This was so much fun and a highlight of our trip. My fianc√© is a huge Jurassic park fan so just being where some of it was filmed was really cool. But the ranch alone is STUNNING. And the tour was so fun and worth $50. 

Day 4:
- to get out of the way of the bride and groom while they got ready, some of us ended up going to a small beach near Turtle Bay. It was amazing. Saw so many turtles and got to enjoy the beach for the first time this trip. 
- on way back we stopped at some food trucks and got lobster dogs which were SO good. 
- wedding time!!! 

Day 5:
- wedding recovery included breakfast with the family and then we all headed back to that same beach we were at the day before. 
- reservation at Beach House by Roy and it was so good. We did the 3 course meal option and I will dream about the pineapple rum cake forever. 

Day 6: 
- coffee and a√ßa√≠ bowls at Keaos Coffee and Espresso. Very yummy bowl and good coffee. 
- checked into hotel: Park Shore Waikiki. 
- we then went to Honolulu Zoo. As a zoo educator and previous zookeeper, I always check out the local zoo! This is a cute and small zoo. But I still enjoyed the habitats for the animals and especially loved the nene habitat!! And as my username suggests, I obviously had to say hi to an old friend, Kendi the rhino and meet his new baby!! 
- catamaran sunset cruise this evening. This trip was with Holokai Catamaran. The crew was excellent and the views were incredible but unfortunately I got soooooo seasick. I was so sad! But the crew made sure I was comfortable and tried all their remedies they had on me. And it did help! My fianc√© loved it though. 

Day 7: 
- now this day may be controversial especially because I asked for tips on this before our trip and became CONVINCED not to island hop but a few days before this I had a dream about a Nene goose that I took care of who passed away super suddenly. This made me realize that I really really wanted to see wild nene and even if it took a day away, going to Big Island for the national park was the best option for me to do that. 
- we flew into Hilo at 7am and picked up our rental car
- Lili ªuokalani Gardens. We did this first because nene were recorded on eBird the day before at the gardens so since it was so close to the airport we didn‚Äôt see any harm in stopping by. It‚Äôs a beautiful garden but we did not see any Nene. 
- we set off on the 45 min drive to Hawai‚Äôi Volcanoes National Park. 
- the park itself was incredible. I‚Äôm so glad we went regardless of the nenes. It was unlike anything I have ever seen and getting to check a NP off our list was great, too! 
- thankfully I told any and every employee I saw that I wanted to see nene so they gave me many spots to try to find them and we did!!!! We saw nine in total!!!
- and then I bought all the nene merch in the visitor center. 
- we stayed at the park for the remainder of the time and left around 4 to catch our 6pm flight. 
- we were landing as the sun was setting in Honolulu and that alone as a really cool sight. 

Day 8: 
- our last day :( 
- we started with a 3.5 hour snorkel and dolphin sight seeing your with WildsideHI 
- I could not recommend this company more for people. I actually went with them because of another redditor. 
- the company is run by a marine biologist who works with NOAA by reporting sightings of the dolphins and marine life they see! 
- they only allow 6 guests on board so it‚Äôs incredibly intimate and a more personalized experience. 
- we saw spotted dolphins, rough tooth dolphins, mahi-mahi, brown footed boobies, a white tip shark, an octopus, plethora of reef fish and 7 turtles at a cleaning station. 
- we popped by Pearl Harbor on the way back to the hotel. 
- we had dinner at barefoot beach cafe as it was really close to our hotel and had good views. The food was good but the highlight here was the pineapple smoothie in a giant pineapple! It was also decently priced. 
- on the walk down we passed A MONK SEAL on queens beach! I was losing my mind!!! There were protective barriers up and a volunteer there monitoring and educating! 
- we watched the sunset and decided to head back to hotel since we had a long day of travel the next day. 

Our trip was amazing. There are a few things I wish we could‚Äôve fit in and probably could have had we not been there for a wedding but that‚Äôs okay! The wedding was beautiful and I‚Äôm so glad the bride and groom wanted us there for their day. 

We also arrived the night of the devestating wildfires in Maui and do not take our privilege for granted. We share ways to help and have even found ways to help ourselves. 

Thank you to the contributors of this subreddit! If it weren‚Äôt for you, we may not have experienced some of the things we did. We are so grateful. Mahalo!",VisitingHawaii

1649613826.0,[Oahu] Enjoy hiking? Here‚Äôs an information dump about 10 hikes I experienced for the first time this year.,"My New Years resolution is to hike 30 trails I‚Äôve never done before. I just finished the first 10, so I thought I‚Äôd post my thoughts on them. I‚Äôve ordered them loosely by difficulty. All of them are in Oahu.

___________________

KAKA‚ÄôAKO WATERFRONT PARK

Type: City park

Highlights:
Take an easy and scenic stroll around the charming Kaka‚Äôako Waterfront Park and Point Panic. The rocky shore, palm trees, and view of Honolulu gives a relaxing, laid back vibe.

https://imgur.com/a/Ua0Aboz

Difficulty:
Easy as it gets. The path is wide and paved without steep hills. There isn‚Äôt necessarily a defined route as the path just loops around and through the length of the park, so how anyone experiences it is up to them. Suitable for all ages and levels of fitness or mobility. Wheelchair accessible.

Crowd level: 
Low to moderate during the day, high around sunset.

_________________

‚ÄòUALAKA‚ÄôA LOOP

Type: Forest

Highlights: 
Lovely stroll through the forest surrounded by unique and interesting flora and fauna. 

https://imgur.com/a/mQU7zR2

Difficulty: 
Easy. Hardest part is finding the trail entrance and the loop connector path. Once you‚Äôre on the right track, it‚Äôs short, flat, and well maintained. Free of roots and debris. Suitable for all ages. Challenging but doable for someone struggling with mobility. Not wheelchair accessible.

Crowd level: 
Medium. Relatively popular among local residents, but out of the way from the bulk of tourists.

_____________________

JUDD TRAIL

Type: Forest

Highlights:
Peaceful walk through a forest with pine trees, ending by a small waterfall and swimming hole.

https://imgur.com/a/P5wpRDK

Difficulty: 
Easy. Short, well maintained trail. Plenty of mud and roots, and a stream crossing that gets deep after rain. Suitable for all ages. Not recommend for those who struggle with mobility. Not wheelchair accessible.

Crowd level: 
Low to moderate around the swimming hole (aka Jackass Ginger Pond), but lower on the trail itself.

_______________________

PU‚ÄôU PIA

Type: Jungle

Highlights: 
Scenic jungle hike up a foothill that ends with a stunning panoramic view overlooking Honolulu.

https://imgur.com/a/QP4MNB5

Difficulty: 
Mostly easy. Very wide and well maintained trail. Some roots and mud. A couple short steep parts. Not ‚Äúclimbing on your hands and feet‚Äù steep, more like ‚Äúdisappointing sledding hill‚Äù steep. Suitable for all ages. Not recommended for those who struggle with mobility.

Crowd level: 
Low. You‚Äôll probably pass a few other groups along the way.

______________________

KOKO CRATER ARCH 

Type: Unique Landmark 

Highlights: 
See and explore a cool lava rock formation in the shape of an arch. Also has great views of the ocean and nearby beaches. 

https://imgur.com/a/ofcISlz

Difficulty:
Mostly easy with a couple challenging parts. Hardest part is getting onto the ridge that the trail begins on. If you go the wrong way, you might have to do some tricky (and potentially dangerous) rock climbing. Take your time and don‚Äôt be afraid to backtrack to find your way. Once you‚Äôre on the ridgeline, it‚Äôs very short, easy, and much more level. Suitable for all ages, not recommended for children under 5. 

Crowd level: 
Moderate. Not packed, but you probably won‚Äôt have it all to yourself.

________________________

LANIKAI PILLBOXES 

Type: Views / Unique Landmark

Highlights: 
Explore a couple of World War II ‚Äúpillboxes‚Äù(military guard-post structures) dug into a ridge that overlooks the world famous Lanikai Beach.

https://imgur.com/a/JeiVrQO

Difficulty: 
Moderate. The steep walk up will have you breathing heavy, but it‚Äôs short and well worth it for the epic views. No shade, so bring extra water and sun protection. A couple narrow sections, so watch your step. Suitable for all ages but not recommended for children under 5.

Crowd level: 
Very high. You‚Äôll be sharing the views with lots of others. Great if you love meeting interesting people, not ideal if you hike to get away from the noise.

_________________________

OLD PALI ROAD

Type: Jungle / Views / Unique Landmark

Highlights: 
Walk on an abandoned highway that‚Äôs slowly being reclaimed by nature. Climb under an active highway and then rise high above it, ending at one of the best viewpoints on the island. 

https://imgur.com/a/tn1zVJh

Difficulty: 
Moderate. It‚Äôs 3 miles out and back, going up the whole first half and down the second half. Going under the highway can be tricky and involves crouching and then climbing a short ladder. You‚Äôll need to squeeze around through metal fence to reach the viewpoint, but the views are just as good if you don‚Äôt, so it‚Äôs not necessary. Suitable for all ages. Not recommended for anyone who has mobility issues.

Crowd level: 
Low. You‚Äôll have it mostly to yourself until you get under the modern Pali highway, then you‚Äôll likely pass quite a few other hikers on the way to the very crowded lookout point. 

_________________________

WA‚ÄôAHILA RIDGE

Type: Views / Forest

Highlights: 
Follow an exciting ridge as it dips and rises its way up toward the Ko‚Äôolau mountain range. There is no shortage of excellent views along the way. 

https://imgur.com/a/muGUxxj

Difficulty: 
Slightly challenging. You‚Äôll find almost no flat sections of this trail; you‚Äôre always either going up or down. There are a couple sections that are very steep, requiring you to use upper body strength to climb up and over rocks. There are side trails that bypass the climbing, but they are slippery with loose dirt and rock. Suitable for hikers of all experience levels and average fitness. Not recommended for children under 7 without previous hiking experience.

NOTE: This review is assuming you turn around at the trail end, where it intersects with the Kolowalu trail. Further on is the much more difficult Mt Olympus summit hike.

Crowd level: 
Low to medium depending on the day and time.

________________________

MAUNAWILI FALLS VIA PALI HIGHWAY

Type: Jungle / Waterfall

Highlights:
A longer scenic route to one of Oahu‚Äôs best hidden waterfalls. Includes lush rainforest, mountain views, a swimming hole at the base of a waterfall, cliff jumping, and even a secret hidden bridge to find.

https://imgur.com/a/BTT2kTo

Difficulty: 
Moderate and lengthy. The Maunawili Trail doesn‚Äôt have too much elevation gain, and is mostly easy, save for some mud and a couple narrow sections. The connector trail to the falls is  muddy and goes down quite a bit, making it a workout for the legs. Getting to the falls is tricky and requires wading in the stream. It is very muddy. Suitable for hikers of all experience levels and average fitness. Not recommended for children under 7 without previous hike experience.

NOTE: getting to the secret bridge ramps up the difficulty significantly. Includes climbing a near-vertical cliff, and bushwhacking along a narrow, slippery path among raw, dense jungle terrain. Avoid crossing over a dangerously narrow pipe by climbing into the ravine underneath it. The secret bridge itself is very sketchy and putting your full weight on it could be extremely risky. Suitable for intermediate to advanced hikers with good fitness and balance.

Crowd level: 
Low on the trail where the crowds are spread out, but high at the falls where it‚Äôs more concentrated.

__________________________

KOKO CRATER ARCH AND EAST RIM

Type: Unique Landmark / Views / Mountain

Highlights:
You‚Äôre not only seeing the arch, you‚Äôre climbing over the top of it! Then you scramble up to the rim of Koko Crater, and follow it to the summit.

https://imgur.com/a/BFsHXvH

Difficulty: 
Moderately challenging. Lots of steep. Use a rope to scale the smooth surface of the arch. The ascent past the arch to the rim will feel like leg day at the gym. A few narrow sections along the rim with treacherous drops on either side, but there are plenty of side trails that bypass the worst of the worst. There is no shade (except under the arch), bring sun protection. Suitable for hikers with intermediate hiking experience as well as decent coordination, balance, and fitness.

Crowd level: 
Very low once you get past the arch. Packed at the summit of the crater. 

___________________________

HAWAI‚ÄôI LOA RIDGE

Type: Mountain

NOTE: a Hawaii ID is required to gain entry to this hike; However, only one person per party needs to show the ID, so non-residents can still do this hike if they go with a local. 

Highlights: 
A ridge hike that takes you on an ascent to the Ko‚Äôolau summit, passing through both forest sections and wide open ridge sections overlooking the scenic valley. An amazing view of the windward side of the island is your reward for pushing through to the end.

https://imgur.com/a/MLNFeqm

Difficulty: 
Strenuous. Not a technical challenge and the path is easy to follow, but it‚Äôs a physically demanding hike. Instead of a steady and consistent upward grade, the first two thirds of the hike gains very little elevation (despite a lot of up and down), meaning the last third is a grind to get to the top. Despite no rope climbing, the terrain is steep, rugged, and challenging to traverse, so it‚Äôs not recommended to attempt this hike if there‚Äôs a chance of rain. Suitable for intermediate hikers, or beginner hikers in good physical shape.  

Crowd level: 
Low. There‚Äôs only ten available parking passes and they don‚Äôt let anyone in if it‚Äôs full.

1678603391.0,[Oahu] My 7 day trip review,"Hi all,

Just came back from a 7 day trip to Oahu with my girlfriend and we wanted to share our itinerary/thoughts as plenty of posts on this subreddit helped us to plan. It was our first time in Hawaii 

***Day one: (Waikiki)***

* Arrived in Waikiki after an overnight flight. Caught an Uber (there's wifi at the airport) to our hotel
* Checked into hotel, walked to Ala Moana mall and went to Foodland for some poke and spam musubi. Was delicious, big thing that surprised us over this entire trip was the portion sizes though. Coming from Australia, my partner and I are used to much smaller serving sizes, we shared almost all meals and always ordered the smallest size available.
* Did some shopping, bought some cheap water shoes
* Had dinner at Paia Fish Market. Recommend getting the blackened fish (we had the mahi mahi and ahi, both are great). 
* Walked around Waikiki at night, this was a chill day

***Day two: (Lanikai)***

* Caught an Uber to pick up our car (rented a Turo, had no issues over the entire trip)
* Drove to Lanikai beach, spent the whole day at the beach
* Went to Hibachi for lunch, their poke was also great
* Did the Lanikai Pillbox hike as things cooled down, awesome view
* Had dinner at K and K Bar B-Que Inn for some quick and nice plate food. Was decent, steak and shrimp plate was average, bbq chicken was good

***Day three: (Hanauma Bay on Sunday)***

* This is what we were most looking forward to but didn't reserve tickets in advance
* We got to Hanauma bay at 6am and parked at the lookout. There were a few other cars there at the time
* We tried to hug the side street of the highway and start lining up early but were quickly told to get lost by the lady working there. 
* Some cars started lining up on the opposite side of the road out of sight from the workers but with quick access to the left turn into Hanauma bay. We were about 4th in line here. As I see it the two best options are to park at the lookout and line up at 6:45, or do what we did and park on the other side of the road
* We drove in after 6:45 and got a ticket for 8:20. We were part of the second group to get let in (around 7:40), you can pay for the access with card.
* Rented snorkelling gear, recommend you get in the water ASAP because this is when the water is clearest.
* **This was the highlight of our trip**, we spent the entire day there alternating between lazing by the beach and getting in the water. Weather was fantastic and left at around 3pm (there is a snack bar so we had lunch there). I would definitely recommend checking it out even if you don't get tickets online (although I tried getting tickets online as a test a few days later and seemed easy if you're online at 7am)
* Had food nearby at Loco Moco Drive Inn. There was a Leonard's bakery truck so we got some Malasada puffs. Was good, went home and crashed given we were up so early
* Woke up around 9pm, thought it was a convenient time to check out Dukes given we didn't have a reservation. Was decent, had a nice view.

***Day four: (North shore)***

* Woke up a bit later and started our drive to north shore. Stopped by Dole plantation as it was convenient and had some Dole whip, was ok. Train line was 1 hour, we weren't interested in any of the activities there anyway.
* Went to Giovanni's shrimp truck. We had the garlic and chilli plates. Were nice! Line wasn't that long and was a good experience
* Drove to Turtle Bay and saw some turtles in the sand. Was a nice place to hang out but we didn't get in the water as it was quite windy this time of year
* Drove to Waimea falls - definitely recommend this! We almost skipped it, but got there just in time to walk to the waterfall and spent half an hour in the water. Was very fun relaxing in the water and swimming to the waterfall.
* Had dinner at Ted's bakery. We shared a loco moco and had the Haupia pie. Both very nice. Brought it to Sunset beach and watched the sunset around 6:30, fantastic way to end the day. Drove home.

***Day five:***

* From this point onwards we decided to take it a bit more relaxed (not jam packing too many things in each day), also we expected the weather to get a bit worse
* Booked the ATV tour at Kualoa ranch. Was fun, recommend you bring sunglasses as it was really windy and dust kept getting into our eyes. Relatively expensive but the view is gorgeous. 
* Went to Coral Kingdom for lunch, shared some Huli Huli chicken, definitely recommend
* Went to Waiahole Poi Factory and shared their traditional plates. This was the best authentic Hawaiian food we had on the entire trip, not our favourite cuisine but I'm glad we got to try something high quality.
* Hung by the pool for the rest of the day
* Went to Pig n Lady for dinner. Didn't have a reservation but it was a late dinner so got in without any issues. Food was nice!

***Day six:***

* Hiked Diamond head around 9am
* Had lunch at Fort Ruger Market. Poke and Filipino food were both fantastic
* Went to Chief's Luau at night. Was a good experience but very expensive. Catching the bus also meant we missed out on a lot of the pre-event show.

***Day seven:***

* Our last day in Hawaii. We had a snorkelling with turtles trip planned but it got cancelled due to weather
* Had a massage, hung by the pool. 
* Went to dinner at Paia fish market again and walked around International Market at night in Waikiki. Was really fun

Overall we had a great time in Hawaii. It's certainly not a cheap trip (depending on what you want to experience) and we got relatively lucky with the weather around this time of year (it occasionally rained and was windy but we were blessed with good weather on the days where it mattered)

I saw there are some waterproof fanny pack type things but what about shoes? Do you just leave them on the beach and hope they're still there after?  ",VisitingHawaii

Dont do as I did. Dragon fruit at night, Acai bowl in the morning, dragonfruit again... there has been uh several interruptions during the day....
On the bright side, the bathrooms in Hawaii, even the ones in public parks are really clean!

But do get fruit, especially in Hilo!",VisitingHawaii
1699299441.0,What souvenirs to get in Hawaii?,"Want to get something that's not available in mainland US if possible. It's for a group gift, so something I can give to 10-20 ppl all at once at a party. I'm thinking some bags of candies or snacks would be the best. For one or two close friends , maybe something more unique. What can I get? Will be on Kauai, oahu, and big island",VisitingHawaii
1674578300.0,Trip Report - Big Island & Oahu,"Thanks to some awesome advice from this sub, my wife and I went to Hawaii for two weeks, and had an amazing time. It was our first time in Hawaii. Days 1 and 14 were mostly travel days, and while we did a few things, I scrubbed them from this.

We had a lot of fun, learned so much, and enjoyed our time. Personally, I preferred Big Island ‚Äì I loved the atmosphere and vibe, I really loved the volcanoes, the people. Oahu just felt too crowded and busy, with too much traffic. I will *never* understand why people, especially people who fly for 10-12 hours, come somewhere to sit at a hotel pool, or at the closest beach (Waikiki) when there are nicer beaches, and amazing things to do. We were watching the 808 cleanups calendar, but they had nothing in the areas we were while we were there, so we donated to their efforts instead. No matter what we did or where we went, we ensured that we packed out *more* than we packed in. I also found myself very regularly screaming at tourists for doing stupid shit, or endangering wildlife/marine life, among other things (e.g., trying to touch endangered dolphins or turtles, standing on reefs, leaving garbage behind, using non-reef friendly sunscreen, etc). It‚Äôs so, incredibly obvious that so many people do no planning, reading, etc., and have no respect for locals, for culture, for rules/laws, among other things., and its quite sad.

Overall, I would go back in a heartbeat ‚Äì to these two islands, and to see the others.

For those doing trip planning:

1. I did likely over 100 hours of research to try to perfect our itinerary, and even then we deviated from it, shifted things, etc. I wanted to ensure that we were respectful of locals, of the culture, and of the islands. We also wanted to ensure that we were doing everything that we wanted to do.
2. We spent about $18,000-$19,000 CAD for two of us, including round trip business class flights from the east coast, inter-island flights (through Hawaiian), both higher end hotels, all activities, rental cars (we had Jeeps on both islands), and all food. Food, gas, souvenirs, and activities alone were about $6000-$7000 CAD (maybe more).
3. Book through Costco for rental cars and hotels. I cannot recommend this highly enough - and remember that you can cancel basically up to the week before if you find a better price (which I did - our initial fairmont Orchid reservation was $2000 more than it was when we got the final booking).

**Big Island**

*Within a couple hours of our arrival, Kilauea started erupting again, so we heavily altered our plan so that we could do a nighttime crater walk.*

**Day 1:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Kalikala Cuisine (Kona) ‚Äì With gorgeous waterfront views and great food, this was an awesome first meal. Friendly wait staff who let us bring our luggage into the patio. Delicious meal, too!
   * Lunch: Gramma‚Äôs Kitchen (Honokaa) ‚Äì While the food was good (nothing special, but a nice filling meal), the experience is what made it. The owner Is walking around, getting to know the customers, chatting with you throughout. Make sure you leave a pin on the map of your hometown!
   * Dinner: Ohelo Caf√© ‚Äì This was a well rated place, so we intentionally planned to grab dinner here. We ordered two margherita pizzas here. The staff were a little bit rude, and shocked that we just wanted margherita pizzas. The pizza was both undercooked (top) and overcooked (crust) ‚Äì it had too much cheese, it was very greasy, and had little to no flavor.
* **Activities:** Waipio Valley Lookout, Shopping in Honokaa Town, Akaka Falls, Hawaii Tropical Bioreserve & Garden, Exploring Hilo, Kilauea Crater Walk
   * Waipio Valley Lookout was a stunning view with lots of history (Waipio / Kohala was the birthplace of Kamehameha the Great).
   * Honokaa is an adorable town with many shops, including restaurants and coffee shops.
   * For Akaka Falls, make sure you park outside of the yellow gate. If you‚Äôre in a hurry, take the left path and you can get to the falls quickly. Beautiful valley and nice falls ‚Äì but try to go when there‚Äôs been a bit more rain.
   * Bioreserve ‚Äì I am so glad we made this stop ‚Äì so many plant species that I‚Äôd never have otherwise seen, and some beautiful views.
   * Kilauea Crater Walk ‚Äì this was one of my #1 things we did ‚Äì this was an experience like no other, and I was distraught when the volcanos stopped erupting in December.
* **Lodging:** Ohia Cottage in Volcano Village (AirBNB) ‚Äì Reasonably priced, easily once of the nicest AirBNBs I‚Äôve been in in a while. Easy check-in, communicative hosts, lots of amenities, and close to HVNP.

**Day 2:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Cereal & Fresh fruit
   * Lunch: Taco Tita (South Point) < The food was yummy, but the portions were HUGE, so order less than you think you need! We tried a few kinds of tacos + the nachos, and a couple lemonades (highly recommend).
   * Dinner: Luana Lounge (Fairmont Orchid, Kona) < The sushi that starts after 5 was delicious!
* **Activities:** HVNP! We got an early start (6AM) and did Devastation Trail, Old Crater Rim Drive Kilauea Lookout, Thurston Lava Tubes, the Steam Vents, Crater Rim Drive, and Chain of Craters Road (incl. Holei Sea Arch). After that, we did the Punalu‚Äôu Black Sand Beach, South Point, and then drove along the south shore up to our hotel.
* **Lodging:** Fairmont Orchid (north of Waikoloa) < Phenomenal hotel. Highly recommend ‚Äì tons of food options, tons of amenities, right on the beach, etc.

**Day 3:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Boring hotel breakfast ‚Äì bagels & breakfast sandwiches
   * Lunch: We went to a local grocery store on the way back and grabbed to-go sandwiches.
   * Dinner: The Fish And The Hog (Waimea) < This was a top 3 meal on our entire trip. Their nachos were fantastic, and the rest of the food & drinks were amazing.
* **Activities:**
   * A bit more of a chill day, we went to Green World Coffee Farms for a tour, which was awesome ‚Äì we learned so much and picked up some delicious coffee. We then relaxed at Hapuna beach, and then climbed Mauna Kea!
      * A couple notes for visiting Mauna Kea: (1) You *must* stop at the visitor centre for at least 30 minutes. Strongly suggest you have a smart watch or something to monitor your HR, so you can see the effect of the altitude on you and know whether you can handle going higher. (2) The drop dead for going up is basically 30 minutes before sunset - rangers will not let you go up at all after that. (3) DRESS WARM. Holy crap there were so many people in shorts and t-shirts.

**Day 4:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: On board the Fairwinds II, we were given a homemade breakfast, including oats, fruit, and some kind of banana bread.
   * Lunch: On board the Fairwinds II, we were given a homemade lunch including jackfruit sliders, salad, sweet potato chips, cookies.
   * Dinner: We grabbed a quick bite at Papa Kona‚Äôs. The avocado fries (sounds weird, I know) were amazing, but the rest of the food was quite generic.
* **Activities:**
   * We did a 4-hour snorkel trip with Fairwinds to Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park. You couldn‚Äôt get me out of the water ‚Äì there was so much to see and I was set on seeing every square inch. They were diligent about ensuring all guests were respectful of the space, using proper sunsgreen, staying in the designated areas, while also ensuring we enjoyed ourselves.
   * We also did the Manta Ray snorkel ‚Äì which was such an incredible experience ‚Äì we saw half a dozen mantas, and one even swam up and touched me & my gopro!

**Day 5:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Juice 101 for some smoothies and bagels.
   * Lunch: We went to the local grocery store and grabbed some dips, salads, sandwiches, etc., and improvised.
   * Dinner: Shaka Tacoz ‚Äì this was undoubtedly in the top 5 for food, probably top 3 for dinner. We got nachos and quesadillas, and they were INCREDIBLE.
* **Activities:**
   * This day got thrown for a loop. We were supposed to do Parrots in Paradise, but the owner got sick and had to cancel, which was a mega bummer. Instead, we did some swimming and tanning. Our hotel had both a normal and a black sand beach, both of which were rich with wildlife including multiple eels, 3-4 turtles, and thousands of fish, so we did some snorkeling!
   * In the afternoon/evening, we went to Pu‚Äôuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park to learn about Polynesian history, and to watch the sunset from this place of refuge.

**Day 6:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Juice 101 again for some smoothies and bagels.
   * Lunch: We grabbed some food at Kona Brewing House ‚Äì it was okay, but not as hyped as the reviews were meant to be!
   * Dinner: ‚Äòili‚Äôili Cash & Carry (Honolulu) ‚Äì this is some of the best pizza I have probably ever had that I‚Äôve not made myself.
* **Activities:**
   * Another much slower day, we hung out on the beach in the morning and did some more snorkeling.
   * We did some exploring in Kona, and the headed to the airport for our flight to Oahu. We got in in the late afternoon, so we grabbed Dinner, went for a walk on the beach, and called it an early night.
* **Lodging**: Alohilani Resort (Waikiki) < An excellent hotel, but, as expected in Waikiki, pretty busy. For some reason, people come to Hawaii to sit on the pool deck 24/7, so it was hard to get chairs if we wanted a lowkey afternoon swimming, because the same people seemed to be there all day all the time.

**Oahu**

**Day 1:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Stonefish Grill (Hale'iwa) < Great breakfast options, very tasty. Originally planned on going to Farm to Barn Caf√© & Juicery, but they were late opening and we were hangry.
   * Lunch: The Beet Box Caf√© < Excellent place for vegetarians and vegans, quite delicious! This was originally going to be Hale‚Äôiwa bowls, but we decided to alter our plans a bit.
   * Dinner: Duke‚Äôs. We did a walk-in, and got lucky with a fast turnaround. < I‚Äôve got to admit, I feel like Duke‚Äôs must be some kind of Hawaiian ponzi scheme, because everyone and their dog tells you to go there, but it‚Äôs SUPER overpriced, and the food is meh at best. We spent upwards of $300 for 2 of us for dinner, a couple of drinks each, one hula pie, and tip, and I‚Äôve had better food at places that cost a fraction of that. My personal advice: Skip it. It‚Äôs really nothing special, there are much better restaurants.
* **Activities:**
   * North Shore day! We stopped at a couple of places for coffee (Morning Glass, Green World Coffee Farm), and then grabbed breakfast.
   * The surf was high and there was a quicksilver surfing tournament going on, so we did some shopping in Hale‚Äôiwa and made our way to Waimea Bay Beach, somehow got a parking spot, and watched the surfing for a few hours. We then drove down the east side of the island and were intending on going to hike up the Lanikai pillbox, but the reports were it taking over an hour to get back from the nearby parking lots, so we decided against it, and went back to the hotel to explore Waikiki.
   * We also went to the Byodo‚ÄôIn Temple, which was spectacular, especially for my wife, who had seen the sister Byodo‚ÄôIn Temple in Japan just a few years prior. Well worth the $5 a person.

**Day 2:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Cereal & Fruit in our hotel room (early start)
   * Lunch: Sunrise Shack for Smoothies, and then Bowles Burritos for some nachos to split. < The smoothies are Sunrise shack are a hidden gem, they‚Äôre excellent. Bowles burritos was also delicious, a very good find.
   * Dinner: The Moani Waikiki. < This place was almost as meh as dukes. They were well rated and had a diverse menu, but they immediately carded us (despite not looking anywhere near underage). I had two pieces of ID, and she saw that we were clearly well above drinking age, but my wife only had 1, and because we were from out-of-country, she refused to accept only one piece of ID from my wife. This kind of killed the vibe, so we ordered, quickly ate, and left. Instead, we went to our hotel‚Äôs rooftop patio and had an amazing night of live music and drinks. Worked out, I guess.
* **Activities:**
   * Hanauma Bay < This place is gorgeous, but gets busy SO fast, so get there early. Some wonderful snorkelling ‚Äì for experiences swimmers, I‚Äôd recommend you go out past the buoys, because there seem to be far fewer waves, and a lot more diverse marine wildlife (the buoys are really just to mark high current areas, but they‚Äôre not very high current).
   * Halona Blowhole, Makapu‚Äôu Point Lighthouse Trail (disregard the ‚Äòeasy‚Äô tags for this trail ‚Äì it‚Äôs all paved, but it‚Äôs a 4 mile straight uphill. It‚Äôs ‚Äòeasy‚Äô, but don‚Äôt wear flip flops),

**Day 3:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Fruit & cereal in our hotel room (early start)
   * Lunch: Something simple at the Kualoa Ranch
   * Dinner: Tame Vegan Izakaya < Even as non-vegans (my wife is vegetarian, I am not), this was PHENOMENAL food. Order two of the spicy to‚Äôfuna.
   * Dessert: We decided to try Leonard‚Äôs Bakery‚Äôs Malasadas. I don‚Äôt really understand the hype behind these. They‚Äôre tasty, but they‚Äôre not worth the 1-2 hours some people tend to wait in the mornings.
* **Activities:**
   * We went early over to Lanikai beach to avoid the crowds and get some morning swimming in. We were supposed to hike Manoa Falls, but due to the lack of rain, there were basically no falls to see, so we scrubbed that.
   * We took the Kualoa Ranch UTV Raptor tour, which was amazing, and so well worth it, then we went back to the hotel for some swimming, exploring Waikiki, and drinks on the rooftop patio.

**Day 4:**

* **Food**
   * Breakfast: Basalt Restaurant < This was one of the better (and one of the few) breakfasts that we had. My wife had the charcoal pancakes (which I‚Äôll be honest, really are seem to be coloured pancakes), but it was all very good.
   * Lunch: We enjoyed it so much that we did ‚Äòili‚Äôili cash & carry again!
   * Dinner: Nutridge Lu‚Äôau provided an excellent meal!
* **Activities**
   * We hiked Diamond Head early early (6AM slot), and were surprised that (A) some people were hiking in flip flops (very uneven terrain), and (B) that the top was covered with over 100 people, even though we started *very* early in the time slot. Definitely take the 6AM window if you can get it ‚Äì I can see it getting very hot, and very busy.
   * Then spent the rest of the morning on Waikiki Beach relaxing, and went to Nutridge Estate and Tantalus Lookout for a Lu‚Äôau. It was amazing ‚Äì much more intimate (not a ton of people), involved, and a great experience.

**Day 5:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: There was a McDonalds nearby, so we grabbed that for a fast breakfast.
   * Lunch: Ono Thai (Ewa Beach), this was very tasty!
   * Dinner: Merriman‚Äôs, this was another place that was pretty hyped, and it very much lived up to the hype, and was reasonably priced! Two appetizers (Parmasean Fries, Homestyle Biscuits), two entrees, and two drinks a piece, and we got out under $120 USD, and quite full still, and quite yummy.
* **Activities:**
   * We did the Ko Olina Lagoons + Secret Beach for some nice swimming and sonrkelling, and then explored the west side of the island a bit more.
   * Then got over to the Pearl Harbour Museum and the USS Arizona Memorial ‚Äì which was quite a somber, emotional experience (even for a Canadian).
   * We explored the Ala Moana Centre, SALT at Our Kaka‚Äôako, and the murals. The murals are *very* cool, and well worth taking the 30 minutes to go see it and walk around.

**Day 6:**

* **Food:**
   * Breakfast: Castro‚Äôs ‚Äì The Tres Leche French toast was delicious, and very filling.
   * Lunch: Haute Dogs at SALT at Our Kaka‚Äôako ‚Äì these were very yummy, like unexpectedly so!
   * Dinner: Appetito Craft Pizza & Wine Bar ‚Äì the pizza was pretty good, but we were crammed into a corner table (even though half the place was empty), and they wouldn‚Äôt let us moved. We somehow felt both rushed, and ignored, all at the same time (e.g., once I gave my card, it easily took him 20 minutes to come back to me with the receipt).
* **Activities:**
   * Bishop Museum ‚Äì we spent a few hours here, it was very educational, and saw all the museum had to offer. Some parts were repetitive (we did Hawaiian Hall last, and felt that a lot of the things on the third level were just repeated information from other exhibits), but I cannot recommend highly enough that people do this in Honolulu.
   * We went to the Palace but were turned away for a tour, so we explored the area, explored the rest of Honolulu, and then swam at our hotel.",VisitingHawaii
1691622629.0,To everyone having a hard time cancelling hotel/Airbnb reservations,"If you paid using a credit card tell them to cancel or you'll contact your credit card company and request a charge back. If you didn't use a credit card it may be worth bluffing and say you did. If this is Airbnb or VRBO and your host refused, reach out to Airbnb/VRBO directly. The odds are very high they will cave cause they know there's a good chance the credit card company would approve the request and they aren't going to want to deal with the fees and dispute involved.

If they still refuse, reach out to your credit card company. They've likely been receiving calls about this all day and can assist you much better than anyone here",VisitingHawaii
1667165082.0,Big Island is safe to visit,"Generally speaking, the farther away from Hawaii a news source is, the more alarmist and less accurate. Here are the facts.

1. Hawaii Island is 4,028 square miles in area. Mauna Loa occupies about half of that landmass.
2. We have been living with ""Mauna Loa will erupt again"" for 38 years.
3. The vast majority of Mauna Loa is uninhabited. Most human structures are only within a few miles of the coast.
4. Kailua-Kona, Kona airport, Waimea, Volcano Village, Pahoa, Honokaa are not located on Mauna Loa.
5. Hilo and Waikoloa are on the slopes of Mauna Loa, but the possibility that any particular spot on the volcano is going to get covered in the next eruption is low. It's not zero, but it is low. The farther from the summit or the rift zones, the lower the risk.
6. The summit region is closed to everyone. There is still some risk for those living on the rift zone. Those areas should never have been developed (see: Leilani Estates 2018, Kapoho 1960 and 2018)
7. There is very little chance that you, personally, will be harmed. Civil Defense in recent years has been extremely vigilant about preventing people from even viewing an eruption, so the perception that you could pull a Gollum and fall into the flow is not accurate.
8. Visitors can fit all they have on this island into their suitcase. And airlines no longer impose change fees. So you really don't have anything to worry about.
9. If the eruption does happen during your visit, it will be a spectacle you will remember forever.

1696212450.0,A Canadian‚Äôs report on a 2 week holiday on the big island in September,"Hello! My partner and I just got home from 2 weeks on the big island and here‚Äôs my report:

*We stayed at a VRBO in Kahaluu Bay

*We rented a car and comfortably drove all over the island without issue. Car rental was $1200 with insurance from Dollar. We found the drivers on the island to be very safe and courteous. 

*I see many people mentioning the homeless people but we had zero issues with them. Yah they are there but they don‚Äôt harass people and we felt completely safe. 

*FOOD: Top 4 restaurants from fanciest to most casual: Huggos - we had our anniversary dinner there and it was OUTSTANDING. Best teriyaki steak I have ever had. Uzmeke‚Äôs - fish market and casual fine dining. Delicious large oysters and best fish and chips on the island. Also has very beautiful decor and great customer service. Fish Hopper - outstanding customer service, great location, and excellent food. Poke Shack - by far the best poke on the island. It‚Äôs open from 11-4 OR UNTIL SUPPLIES LAST and it‚Äôs closed on Saturdays. Extremely limited parking so suggest you park at the church down the street. Special shout out to Magic‚Äôs because they have fantastic customer service. DO NOT GO TO SAM CHOY‚ÄôS. 

*ACTIVITIES - #1 best experience was hiking down to the Captain Cook monument and snorkelling there. Best snorkelling in the world. Bring bags that can completely seal because the mongoose go into peoples‚Äô bags and steal food. #2 was Volcanoes National Park. We did the Kilauea Iki Trail and Crater Rim Trail which was 6.5 km. Walk counter clockwise to make it easier and be sure to go walk through the lava tube. Be prepared for ALL weather. Definitely also stop at Punalu‚Äôu Bakery on the way there for delicious donuts. Akaka falls near Hilo is another awesome park that I highly recommend. We also visited a historic coffee farm, a chocolate farm, and a few other historic sites. We did the ‚Äúswimming‚Äù with the manta rays thing and it was a HUGE HUGE HUGE rip off. This was the most recommended activity to us and I felt so ripped off. There is no swimming involved at all. You pay $100 US to hold on to a paddle board for 30 mins while you maybe catch a glimpse of a couple rays. 

*BEER - my partner is a beer enthusiast so we visited all 5 breweries on the island and here is how they rank: #1 Big Island Brewhaus in Waimea. It‚Äôs some of the best beer he‚Äôs ever had and is totally worth the drive to Waimea just for that. #2 Hilo Brewing. Delicious and great customer service. #3 Kona Brewing. Very well established and solidly good. #4 Ola Brewing in Kona. #5 Wailuku Brew Works in Hilo was terrible. Give it a miss. 

*Turtles. The best place to see turtles is at Aiopio Fish Trap. Put the yacht club into your GPS, drive down the road towards the club and then take your first right and follow that alllll the way to the end. Park and follow the path to the beach. 

*Shopping is great!! We especially loved the shops in Hilo and they have a fantastic farmers market on Wednesdays. 

*Additional Info - it is HOT there. Do not go anywhere without water. This may be obvious to many people but this Alberta girl really struggled with the heat. We did a fair bit of walking and hiking and were totally fine in Birkenstocks and Tevas. You don‚Äôt really need running shoes even for the hikes. September is a fantastic time to go! There were very few tourists there. 

*It‚Äôs important to note that this place has a very chill island vibe. Some businesses keep somewhat odd hours and food/drinks often takes a while. People drive the speed limit. I have spent a lot of time on the Gulf Islands so I am accustomed to this but some people see it as bad service. Try to just go with the flow. 

That‚Äôs it folks. Please feel free to ask me anything you like.

Edit: WHAT TO BRING - I was sooooo glad that I had brought a couple lingerie bags to wash my many strappy swimsuits in. Also bring bandaids and polysporin because the beaches are quite sharp and rocky and it‚Äôs easy to cut/graze yourself. Clothing wise, you will fit in well in normal casual clothes. You may also want to bring a couple different waterproof bags. We always felt like our valuables were safe on the beach when we were in the water but I wish I had remembered to bring mine.",VisitingHawaii
1666054661.0,Very Long Trip Report of our 2 Week Stay on Oahu and BI!,"Recently got back from an **awesome** 2 week stay on Oahu and the Big Island with my husband. We had never been to either. This was a delayed 10th anniversary celebration for us and a big splurge/treating ourselves kind of trip. 

We had previously been to Maui twice and Kauai once and loved those as well. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to pick a favorite, we‚Äôve really enjoyed all our trips to Hawaii so far.

We followed our itinerary pretty closely, making some adjustments as needed or depending on how we felt. The planning is almost as fun as the trip for me lol. We did a lot, but never felt overwhelmed or rushed, and felt like we had plenty of time to relax too. With all the horror stories of travel lately, we were pleasantly surprised at how smoothly and quickly everything went, we got lucky! 

Read a lot of posts here to help me plan and found it so helpful, **thank you!** 

Wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend any of the experiences we had, places we visited, restaurants we ate at, or anywhere we stayed. Loved it all! The service everywhere, from everyone, was always great. 

Little tip- if you‚Äôre making a reservation and you‚Äôre celebrating a special occasion, don‚Äôt hesitate to let them know if there‚Äôs the option to do so. We were surprised with complimentary desserts at a few different restaurants, which was really nice, and a bottle of champagne and yummy platter of snacks at the Fairmont Orchid.

Flew from Newark to Austin. Used both Clear and Precheck and got through security very quickly. We were there pretty early so airport wasn‚Äôt too busy, but I‚Äôd definitely recommend them if you can do it. I used the free 2 month trial of Clear. 

Did the flight this way because I redeemed JetBlue points on Hawaiian Airlines for a first class flight from Austin to HNL, as there was no reward availability from either Boston or JFK. We found it nice to break up the trip a little though and spend an afternoon in Austin, where we had also never been. 

Stayed at Holiday Inn Austin Airport. The free shuttle to and from the airport was convenient, used Lyft a couple times to get around, and found the hotel to be clean and comfortable, just what we needed for the night. 

**Thursday Sept, 29**

9:30am flight out of Austin, smooth going through the airport with Clear and Precheck again. Got to Oahu around 12:30pm, a little bit earlier than expected. The HA flight was very comfortable and service was awesome. 

Got luggage pretty quickly, and pick up of our rental car from Alamo was fast and easy. Kept checking prices through different sites before the trip, and rebooked as prices dropped, eventually booking directly with Alamo, and used Skip the Line, which was a great feature. 

Stopped at Longs on our way to our hotel to buy a couple bottles of sunscreen, figured it was easier to have one less thing to pack. 

Stayed 6 nights at Kahala Hotel & Resort. Kept an eye on prices and eventually booked the prepaid rate through the Mastercard World travel portal, since it was cheaper than anything I found on the hotel‚Äôs website. Thought the hotel was beautiful, liked it was in a quieter area than Waikiki but still close to everywhere we wanted to go. Didn‚Äôt like the idea of the captive dolphins on their property, but that‚Äôs just me. They seem well cared for, and saw lots of kids having fun, but the area they live in seemed so small.  Everything else at the hotel was lovely. 

After checking in, spent a couple hours at the beach and then had a dinner reservation at Arancino. Tried to stay awake as long as possible, but with the time change and long travel day passed out at 7:30pm. 

**Friday, Sept. 30**

Woke up around 4:30am while still adjusting. I liked how easy it was for me to wake up early with the time difference during our stay though. 

Pearl Harbor this morning. Had a quick but good breakfast at the Koa Pancake House nearby PH. Spent some time looking at all the exhibits, and then had a 10am reservation for the USS Arizona. While at the Memorial, someone made an announcement that the Minister of Defense for the Philippines was visiting, and would be coming through in a moment. We stepped to the sides and he walked through with a delegation of some military and their US Ambassador, then they all got on a private boat back. 

After our Pearl Harbor visit, we drove to Tantalus Lookout. Beautiful views for little effort! Next was lunch at Cafe Morey‚Äôs and back to the hotel for a couple of hours relaxing by the pool/beach. 

That evening, we decided to go into Waikiki. We found a spot right away in the lot by the zoo. Parking here was less than we were expecting. Enjoyed just walking down Kalakaua Ave. Tried to eat at Steak Shack, but the wait would be 45 minutes and we were still kind of full from lunch anyway, just got dole whip/ice cream instead haha. We were going to wait to see the fireworks, but we were getting pretty tired and decided to just go back to the hotel instead. 

**Saturday, October 1**

Went over to Jack‚Äôs Restaurant near the hotel and had a good diner style breakfast (not Jack in the Box which one of the hotel employees thought we meant at first lol). Morning at the pool, had shave ice from Uncle Clay‚Äôs, and then around noon drove to Byodo-In Temple for a visit. I was a big fan of Lost when it was on TV, so had a bunch of Lost filming locations on my list. This was a pretty spot. 

After the temple, we got to Kualoa Ranch around 2pm for our 3pm tour. Loved our 2 hour ATV ride. The guides were great and hilarious, the scenery was amazing, lots of fun. Like everyone says, we were very dusty at the end. Used their sinks, and also had brought a couple of Dude shower wipes with us. 

Back to the hotel for much needed showers. Went back to Waikiki in the evening, parking at the International Marketplace for dinner at Paia Fish Market. The line moved pretty quickly and food was delicious. Easy to use apps for all the parking during our stay, and then they text you a reminder and ask if you want to add more time. 

**Sunday, October 2**

Had an 8:00am-10:00am Diamond Head reservation. Decided to have the breakfast buffet at our hotel and then got to Diamond Head a little before 8:30. We brought our camelbak pack from home so had plenty of water with us, found it very useful to have on all our hikes. We were glad it was overcast because even with the clouds we were still very sweaty and tired when we made it to the top, but worth it for the experience and view. Just as we were getting to our car, it started raining a bit, and then had a pretty good downpour while driving to our next stop, Ko‚ÄôOlina. 

Originally, we were going to spend some time at the beach here, but it ended up raining on and off all afternoon. We didn‚Äôt mind that it was a rainy day though, because we had a couples massage at the Four Seasons Spa, so just spent time using the facilities there. We had a bite to eat and drinks at Watermans before checking in. (Side note, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol but my husband does. I was pleased with the selection of different and delicious ‚Äúmocktail‚Äù or ‚Äúzero proof‚Äù drinks on a lot of menus on both islands.) Had our massages in an outdoor hale, which was nice. 

When we were done there, the rain finally seemed to stop, so we walked along the beach path a bit, and then went over to Monkeypod Kitchen for our 5:15 dinner reservation. Wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, but a little annoying thing was that when we got there and checked in, we were given a buzzer and told it would be ‚Äújust be a few minutes‚Äù. We ended up waiting a little over a half hour. I know places are busy, understaffed, and I normally don‚Äôt mind waiting at all, we just weren‚Äôt expecting it to be that long. Maybe the wait would have been longer without the reservation? Afterwards I saw a couple reviews where people mentioned the same thing happening. Oh well, we still enjoyed the food and our evening, just happy with the fact we were in Hawaii. 

**Monday, October 3**

Windward Coast day. Had breakfast at Island Brew Coffeehouse in Hawaii Kai, then stopped for some beautiful views at Lanai Lookout and Halona Blowhole. Next was the Makapu‚Äôu Lighthouse trail. We were glad we did this on the early side as suggested, because even with the nice breeze and tiny bits of shade it was hot. Loved the view from the top and stayed there for a while. 

After the hike, we stopped at Kalapawai Market for sandwiches that we put in a little cooler bag from home. Drove to Kailua Beach Park, there were still plenty of places to park when we got here. By the time we were leaving there were multiple people waiting for spots. Beautiful beach, enjoyed the couple of hours we spent here. We had rented chairs and an umbrella from Hawaii Beach Time, which they delivered and picked up from our hotel. 

After the beach, stopped at Island Snow for shave ice, then Nu‚Äòuanu Pali Lookout on our drive back to The Kahala. Spent some more time at the pool before getting ready for dinner. 

Had dinner at Original Roy‚Äôs Hawaii Kai. Excellent meal and service. We definitely gained some weight on this trip haha. They even gave us a $25 gift certificate to use another time since we were celebrating our anniversary, so I guess we‚Äôll have to come back ;) 

**Tuesday, October 4**

North Shore day. We were going to have breakfast at Hale‚Äôiwa Bowls but didn‚Äôt seem like it was open yet when we got there, so had acai bowls from Island Vintage Coffee. 

Drove over to Banzai Pipeline, walked a bit, and then just sat on the beach watching the waves and surfers for a while. The waves were bigger than we thought for October, can‚Äôt even imagine what they look like in the winter. 

After admiring the ocean for a while, felt a few rain drops and headed back to the car- made it back just in time for some heavy rain. Made our way over to Ted‚Äôs to wait it out and had the chocolate haupia pie and some other kind of pastry. Pie was good, but we both thought the pastry was better. 

After our snack and rain shower, went over to Waimea Bay. By this point, the traffic was starting to build up, especially because one lane was closed for construction, so took a little longer getting there than it had taken to get to Pipeline. Spent a couple of hours on the beach with our rented chairs and umbrella, and had a lot of fun swimming/playing in the waves. Lifeguards made warning announcements any time bigger swells were coming in and let parents know the smaller kids should come out of the water. By the time we were leaving, the traffic heading in the opposite direction was crazy backed up, glad we started with Pipeline early and were headed back toward Haleiwa. 

Made one more quick stop at Papailoa Beach, so I could see another Lost filming location. Thought I might want to go over to Mokule'ia Army Beach too but decided not tosince I figured the view was probably similar and we were getting quite hungry. 

Lunch was Surf n Salsa back in Haleiwa . Back to the hotel to shower, rest, and pack up a little bit. Went into Waikiki one more time that evening for some browsing/shopping. Thought we would have dinner somewhere here too, but I was still full from the tacos. Stopped into Maui Brewing Company later for my husband to enjoy a beer. 

**Wednesday, October 5**

9:30am flight to Hilo. Got to the airport I think around 8am and everything went smoothly. Not the best breakfast place we could have gone to, but Starbucks at the airport was a convenient choice. Landed a little earlier than planned and got our rental car from Enterprise pretty quickly, no one in line when we got there (this seemed to happen to us a lot, which I know isn‚Äôt usually the case at airports.) Booked through Discount Hawaii Car Rental, which we had used in the past. 

We had some time before we could check in to our Airbnb, and I know it‚Äôs highly discouraged to keep luggage in the car, but we took the chance anyway. We knew the risks, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you can avoid it. Had all luggage in the trunk, never opened it, tried to limit the amount of time we were away from the car, and had nothing visible when we got out. I was nervous, but thankfully no break-ins. 

First took a stroll around Liliuokalani Gardens, then went over for a short stop at Rainbow Falls. Had a 12:15pm reservation at Cafe Pesto, so headed back that way, took a quick look around the produce side of the farmer‚Äôs market and then lunch.  

Next drove over to our stay in Volcano (Booked this before I read all the stuff about AirBnBs on the thread here, but I did check to make sure it was legal.) It was really nice, with an outdoor seating area, and then a room with lots of windows/sliding doors that had a comfy bed and little sitting area, a small kitchen area and bathroom. Perfect for the 2 nights we needed it. 

Just relaxed for a few hours and got settled in, then drove back to Hilo for dinner at Jackie Rey‚Äôs. Thought it might be a little hectic to drive all the way back to Hilo, but we didn‚Äôt find it to be bad at all. If we hadn‚Äôt gone back to Hilo, probably would have tried Ohelo Cafe or the Thai place in Volcano. After dinner we went to Puna Chocolate Company and bought lots of snacks, sipping chocolate, and frozen hot chocolate. 

**Thursday, October 6**

Back when I first booked our flights, I had no idea that the World Ironman Championship even existed, only found out after doing some more detailed research, so was pleased our schedule worked out that we would be in VNP this day since this was one of the competition days. 

We got up on the earlier side, but not early enough to see the lava before sunrise. Had breakfast in the room, then over to the park, loved being just a few minutes away. First stopped at the steam vents, then went on to hike the Kilauea-Iki trail. When we started out it was cooler, foggy, and a bit rainy, but by the time we were down in the crater, the sun was out and it started to get hot. Such an awesome experience though. Felt like I was on the moon. 

At the end of the trail we went across the parking lot to the Thurston Lava Tube, and then the hike back to the trailhead parking lot.  By the time we got back to the car, we were happy for the AC. Went out of the park for lunch at Eagles Lighthouse, then back for a stop at the Visitor‚Äôs Center (wasn‚Äôt open yet earlier) and then the drive down Chain of Craters road. This was great too, and we listened to the Shaka Guide along the way. Gorgeous views and interesting history. 

Spent the rest of the late afternoon back at the AirBnB, then went to Dimple Cheek Cafe in Mountain View for dinner. 

Back to relax in our room again a while longer, then ventured out for the lava glow. Parked at the Devastation Trailhead and did the walk down the old Crater Rim Drive. Got to the parking lot around 9pm, and it was still pretty full, but we didn‚Äôt have a problem getting a spot. Seeing the lava lake and sky/clouds glowing was a super cool experience. We brought flashlights and a headlamp but didn‚Äôt even need them on the walk because the moon was so bright, full or almost full. (Which unfortunately took away from the view of the stars.) 

**Friday, October 7**

Breakfast at the AirBnB and then packed up to make our way to the other side of the island. 

Took the risk again with our luggage in the car, making sure to have everything in the trunk and nothing in the front.  Drove back to Hilo for a quick stop at Puna Chocolate again to buy a poster we wanted to get (it was raining the other night we were there and didn‚Äôt want it to get wet) and more frozen hot chocolate. 

Drove along the coast with our first stop at the Hawaii Tropical Bioreserve and Garden. Very pretty! Spent I think 2 hours here. Cooled off after with the popsicles they sell there. Next was lunch at Surf Break Cafe in Honomu, then on to see Akaka Falls. 

From there we drove straight to the Fairmont Orchid, where we stayed 6 nights. Considered the Mauna Lani, but the nightly rate was double what we paid at the Fairmont, plus I used some ALL points toward the bill at check out. We found the hotel, especially the grounds, to be quite nice, even though it hasn‚Äôt been updated in a while. 

We spent the rest of our afternoon at the pool until sunset. Loved that we could see turtles every evening on the shore right there (behind a fence to protect them). Had dinner at Hale Kai on the property. 

The only small complaint of our stay was that we found the room to be on the warmer side (something I had read about in reviews prior.) The temp in the room never reached the temp the thermostat was set to. Not a big deal, except a little hot for us to sleep, I tend to get very warm at night. Someone from maintenance did come to look a couple hours after we checked in and afterwards it was much better than when we first arrived. We did close the shades in the room every time we left to keep the sun out, which also helped. 

**Saturday, October 8**

Planned a resort day due to the second Ironman race road closures. Had breakfast at Mauna Lani Coffee Company just a couple minutes away since it was in the resort community, then stayed at the Fairmont the whole day, lounging around and enjoying the pool and beach. Liked that they provided sunscreen at the pool. 

We signed up for an outrigger canoe ride for that afternoon with the hotel, and the ‚Äúbeach boys‚Äù as they were called, Ahi and Noah, were great. Very accommodating to us, even though they had been having scheduling problems with the concierge. We went out further than we were expecting, and got to swim next to the canoe for a bit. Fun time! 

Dinner was at Tommy Bahama since that was close by as well and didn‚Äôt need to go out to the main road, followed by listening to some live music at Luana Lounge at the Fairmont. 

**Sunday, October 9**

This morning we drove up to Hawi for breakfast at Kohala Coffee Mill followed by the Polol≈´ Valley hike. There were a couple people there to go over some things we should know before the hike (what to expect, areas to avoid, be respectful of the area as it is near burial grounds, no posting of photos on social media.) 

The way down was the easy part, and even though we‚Äôve done many hikes before in a number of states, we both found the way back up really knocked us out for some reason, went very slowly and stopped a bunch of times because we kept getting out of breath. Also don‚Äôt think I ever sweat that much in my life haha, a theme of this trip (even though we started earlier in the morning). Another very beautiful spot, we spent some time watching some surfers there on the beach, and on the way back up just stopped to admire the views while resting. 

We were going to take the Kohala Mountain Road to eat lunch at The Fish and the Hog in Waimea but neither of us were hungry yet and we were pretty worn out, so just went back the way we came and spent the rest of the day relaxing at the hotel. 

Dinner was at Pueo‚Äôs Osteria, another delicious meal. 

**Monday, October 10**

Breakfast today was malasadas at the truck near Beach 69- yum! (Never got the chance to try Leonard‚Äôs or Tex‚Äôs so can't compare) Great that they make them to order, and worth the wait. We devoured 3 of them between the 2 of us lol wanted to get more but were too full. If anyone‚Äôs curious, the 3 we had were sugar with coconut filling, li hing with lilikoi filling and cinnamon sugar with nutella filling. 

We had planned to spend a few hours at Hapuna Beach, but when we got there, there was a sign saying park closed, no water. A woman by the sign told us that unfortunately it would be closed for a couple of days but that we could go to the ‚Äúsister beach down the road.‚Äù instead. This ended up being back at Beach 69. 

We had chair rentals that Hulakai delivered to our hotel, and spent a couple hours at the beach here. It was quite nice and the water was clear and beautiful. 

I think it was a little crowded for its size, probably a lot of people that otherwise would have been at Hapuna were here instead, but we didn‚Äôt mind. I see now on the Hawaii state parks site that there was ‚Äúa major water break‚Äù and it says the park and cabins will be closed through the end of the month. 

When we were ready for lunch, went to Kohala Burger and Taco, went into a couple of the nearby shops, then spent a little bit of time back at the Fairmont pool. 

Down to Kona for dinner at Kai Eats. Nice spot for the sunset. The underground parking next to the restaurant was $30 for an hour, whoa! Didn‚Äôt realize when we drove in there and didn‚Äôt want to spend more time searching around after we were already parked. Those were the prices we were expecting in Honolulu.

After dinner was our manta snorkel. Booked the tour with Hawaii Island and Ocean Tours and had a blast. There were a group of 6 of us that went out on a short boat ride. I wore the provided wetsuit, but the water was very warm. I was comfortable with it on, and my husband was fine without it. 

Amazing experience, the mantas almost didn‚Äôt look real when they were swimming right in front of our faces. Our guide said there were 6-8 different ones around. We saw a couple right away, and then it got quiet, so we moved to a different area and then saw a lot more activity again. 

I tend to get seasick, so I was glad I took a dramamine before. I was fine up until the very end, on the boat ride back I started to feel a little queasy, but it passed quickly. I wasn‚Äôt even cold when we got out of the water, but had a hot chocolate they provided us with anyway. My husband and I were surprised at how much our arms felt like jelly and hurt for the next 2 days from hanging onto that surfboard. Just a small warning, the bathroom at the harbor was closed by the time we got back, I think it was a little after 9pm but can‚Äôt quite remember. 

**Tuesday, October 11**

Spent the morning at the hotel and grabbed something from Brown‚Äôs Deli there for breakfast. 

We booked the 12pm lunch and tour at Hawaiian Vanilla Company and had a great time. Food was delicious, tour was interesting and funny, had no idea how labor intensive growing vanilla was, and it really does seem like a labor of love for them. Elliott and his brother were great! (I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm blanking on his name right now). Bought a bunch of goodies to take home too. 

Thought we‚Äôd balance out the vanilla with a stop at Honoka'a Chocolate Company after. Got to sample a few pieces and learn a bit about the company and their chocolate, and bought some bars there as well. 

Driving back through Waimea, went to Big Island Brewhaus for my husband to try a flight of their beers. He liked all the ones he had. 

After some time back at the hotel, dinner was at Foster‚Äôs Kitchen Waikoloa. I‚Äôm not usually a huge fan of banana desserts, but their take on banana pudding was great. 

**Wednesday, October 12**

Today‚Äôs breakfast was at Island Vintage Coffee (liked it on Oahu and it was close to the hotel, so figured we‚Äôd try it again). 

Our morning activity was the beautiful Pu‚Äôuhonua o H≈çnaunau National Historical Park. Sat and watched the video for a bit and then explored the grounds. Wish we had time for snorkeling next door too. There are a lot of things from both islands we‚Äôll have to come back for =)

Next was Greenwell Farms for their coffee tour. I‚Äôm not a coffee drinker, but we both found the tour interesting and my husband enjoyed the free samples. We also got to sample a peppercorn right from the vine that they grow there. I know it‚Äôs pepper and all, but it was spicier then I imagined haha. 

Lunch was at Teshima‚Äôs, made it there just before their 1:30 last call for their 2pm closing time. Another delicious meal. Have to say again, we very much liked all the restaurants we went to. 

Stopped for some last minute souvenirs in Kona, then back to the hotel to start packing and freshen up. We stayed at the resort again for the rest of the evening, enjoying the sunset from their Adirondack chairs and then some more live music at Luana Lounge. I was still full from lunch, but my husband enjoyed their sushi. 

**Thursday, October 13**

Splurged on a second hotel buffet breakfast so we wouldn‚Äôt have to go out anywhere before heading to the airport. It was good, but thought the Kahala‚Äôs was better. 

We flew from Kona-Honolulu, and then Honolulu-Newark on United for our flight home. Easy drop off of rental car and short shuttle ride to the terminal. Our flight from Kona-HNL was on HA, booked through United, so we had to pay HA checked bag fee. 

We forgot to check our boarding passes before going over to Security and the precheck was listed on mine, but somehow fell off of my husband‚Äôs along the way, not sure what happened there. Luckily the airport wasn‚Äôt too busy and there wasn‚Äôt a wait for him to go through the regular line. 

**TLDR** 

We had a fabulous time with 6 nights on Oahu at The Kahala, and 8 nights on Big Island at an AirBnb in Volcano and the Fairmont Orchid, enjoying a lot of the major/popular sights. We fit a lot in, but also spent a lot of time relaxing at the pools and beaches. 

Thanks again to all the advice here!

We are going to keep it low key in Waikiki with only a few travel spots and most of what we plan to see is available by city buses. Is this a crazy idea and we should rent a car? We are big walkers when we travel and have never rented a car while traveling so unsure by all the posts I read about which car rental company to go with, if we are making a wise choice. Help! Also first time in Hawaii. We appreciate any insight.

1656613658.0,Maui and Big Island in 8 Days ‚Äì A June Trip Report,"Against the advice of many Hawai‚Äôi advisors on Reddit, my husband and I did our first ever trip to Hawai‚Äôi on 2 different islands in just 8 days/7 nights:  4.5 days on Maui, 3.5 on the Big Island. Overall, we had an excellent time and it didn‚Äôt feel too short at all. However, this was by no means a relaxing vacation, so we were pretty excited to go home and rest by the end. If you want to see it all and are okay with doing a lot of prep and having a very active itinerary, I think island hopping in a week is a perfectly acceptable choice. If you want to relax in a tropical paradise‚Äîstick to one island lol

Bullet summary:

**Who we are**

* A couple in their mid-twenties on their belated honeymoon
* Reasonably but not especially fit

**Lodging**

* 3 nights in the Days Inn at Kihei‚Äîloved this place. Affordable, comfortable, great AC, beach towels to borrow, and free small breakfast
* 1 night in an Airbnb in Hana‚Äîeconomical, but we weren‚Äôt prepared for the jungle-y, no-AC ruralness
* 2 nights in the Grand Naniloa Doubletree in Hilo‚Äî‚ÄúNicest‚Äù place we stayed, no complaints
* 1 night in the Royal Kona in Kona‚ÄîNot a big fan, the parking situation was miserable

* Hawaiian Style Caf√© in Hilo, Big Island‚Äîtried saimin, loco moco, and poi. Affordable and very local feeling, like a little local diner
* Lava Rock Caf√© in Volcano, Big Island‚ÄîCheeseburger and Shrimp Alfredo, a fine choice
* Shaka Tacos in Ali‚Äôi Gardens Marketplace, Kona, Big Island‚ÄîA good chicken quesadilla with yummy sauce, kinda pricey
* Gecko Girls shave ice in Kona, Big Island‚ÄîGood shave ice & ice cream, pricey though

**Biggest Recommendations**

* Use the GypsyGuide app if you‚Äôre doing lots of driving, esp. for Road to Hana. It truly enriches your whole trip
* If you‚Äôve never snorkeled before, try a very calm area first and/or book a tour
* Kihei was an excellent home base to explore Maui‚Äîcentral, pleasant, and affordable
* Hilo is good if you like overcast, drizzly weather and a more local feel.
* If you're in Kona, do a night manta snorkel. It's worth it. A magical experience.

VERY Detailed Itinerary for the curious

We chose Maui and the Big Island because we wanted to experience the luxurious beaches as well as the famous Road to Hana, but the active lava in Kilauea was a must see. We‚Äôre also not fans of crowds, so while they‚Äôre unavoidable in Hawai‚Äôi, we knew we wouldn‚Äôt enjoy Oahu nearly as much as other islands.

Day 1:

We arrived in Maui in the morning so we had the whole day ahead of us. We hit up Costco for some snacks and a small lunch, then headed towards Kihei. Our first stop was the **Maui Tropical Plantation** in central Maui. This was an awesome first thing to do in Hawaii. It was a great introduction to the fantastic foliage in Hawaii, a first glimpse at the sugar plantation history, and included a local crafty market/gift shop.

After killing more time in Kihei until we could check into the Days Inn, we grabbed some dinner from Panda Express then picked a nearby beach to enjoy‚Äîwe ended up at **Makena Beach**, also known as ‚Äúbig beach,‚Äù then wandered farther north and stumbled upon **Little Beach**, which is an unofficial nude beach. Little Beach turned out to be our favorite‚Äîsuper serene, not many people, and a gorgeous spot to watch the sunset, unlike Big Beach, which had a blocked sightline to the sun by a rocky outcropping. Sitting and enjoying the sunset was a perfect way to end our first day in Maui.

Day 2:

This was our day to snorkel and explore the west side of Maui. We got an early start and drove to the Lahaina area to **snorkel Black Rock**. Neither of us had snorkeled in the ocean before, or even much ocean swimming experience in general, so it was very fun to see the fish and coral near the cove. We read that beginners shouldn‚Äôt go around the corner of the cove, but we weren‚Äôt paying close enough attention and ended up much farther than we wanted to be. The waves at the tip of the cove outcropping were rough, and neither of us could swim ourselves back to shore. We had to climb up on the rocks to get safe, getting some nasty leg scrapes. It wasn‚Äôt like we almost drowned, but it could‚Äôve headed there quickly. That part was not fun. In retrospect, I wish we had chosen somewhere super easy like Baby Beach, or better yet, book a tour. Having a boat take you to the snorkel spot, and being able to get on the boat when you‚Äôre tired, sounds so much better than swimming yourself to the spot and swimming back.

Despite being very much shaken up by our snorkel experience, we got back in the car and headed up the north side of the coast to **Nakalele Blowhole**. This place was awesome. There‚Äôs a crazy windy overlook that‚Äôs fun to stand at for a few moments, then you can hike down to get closer to the blowhole and see the gorgeous coastline.

We would have tried snorkeling at the Honolua Bay marine reserve, but we were too scared and exhausted. To get back, we just drove back the same way we came in, taking about an hour to walk through Lahaina and see the shops before making it back to Kihei. We showered up, then shopped and ate in Wailea. We finished the day back at Makena beach for sunset.

Day 3:

We tried to snorkel at **Maluaka Beach**, aka Turtle Town, but we were still too scared of the waves and currents farther out, so instead we enjoyed swimming in the relatively calm waves at the shore for an hour or so before going back to the hotel to shower.

Next was **Haleakala National Park!** My new favorite national park of all time. We used the Gypsy Guide all the way up and down and it made the drive super interesting, particularly learning about Nene birds and Silversword plants. We got there around 3:30, well after the visitor center closed, but we enjoyed walking partway down the Sliding Sands trail to get further into the crater. I absolutely loved this trail. It is challenging to go uphill all the way back, but there was a part on the trail where you could sit, take a break, and take in the magnificent view. Love love loved this place with all my heart.

We stayed at the top, but not the summit out of fear of losing parking, through sunset. It was beautiful, but the windchill up there is intense! We had long pants over our shorts, a long sleeve over our t-shirts, and our rain jackets on and it was still a little rough. We couldn‚Äôt bring ourselves to stay until dark to see the stars.

Day 4:

**Road to Hana!** We're staying the night in Hana so no stress to get back. I thought we got a great start leaving Kahului by 8am, but the traffic was still bad. We couldn‚Äôt see Twin Falls and many other stops because it was just too full. We did wait through the line to enter the **Garden of Eden** ($20/person) which we thoroughly enjoyed. There‚Äôs tons of gorgeous foliage you can see all at once, as well as a couple amazing overlooks and a chance to feed some peacocks. If you go here, you‚Äôll hardly need to go to any other botanical gardens.

After the garden we went straight through until the **Keanae Peninsula**. The line for the banana bread shop there was ludicrous, but we got to see the craggy lava beach for a few moments before it started to rain hard. Continuing on, we got some cool drone footage at **Kamoa Beach**, but it rained hard again before we could see Hamoa Beach.

We avoided most stops if they were at all crowded, but we fought our way into some parking for **Wailua Falls.** Absolutely stunning.

From there we powered straight through to the **Kipahulu Visitor center on the east coast**, arriving at about 3:30 pm, in time to shop our fill. We considered trying to do the Pipiwai Trail to see the Waimoku Falls, but determined it was too late and we weren‚Äôt in good enough shape, so we took our time at the **Pools of Ohe‚Äôo** which were very very pretty. No swimming allowed when we were there.

We made it back to Hana at about 5pm, where we checked in to our Airbnb, relaxed, and got a burger at one of the few food trucks left open at 6pm: Ae‚Äôs Thai Kitchen.

Day 5:

We left Hana at about 7:30, getting to our **Wainapanapa State Park** morning reservation at 7:45 am to see Maui‚Äôs Black Sand Beach. Surprisingly there were already tons of people there. We walked along some pathways to the right of the beach, which was very scenic, then hopped back in the car.

We made a pit stop at **Aunty Sandy‚Äôs** again at Keanae Peninsula, when the line was much more reasonable‚Äîjust a few people‚Äîfor the banana bread. It was hot and fresh and absolutely delicious. Then we powered through the rest of Hana back, having fun trying to keep up with the locals (but not trying too hard. They really zoom through those curves!)

Next we had our flight to Hilo. I didn‚Äôt realize my Southern Airways plane tickets were through the Mokulele Airlines, which is a commuter airline that locals use and operates out of a separate, and outdoor, airport. We got there way too early thinking we had to go through TSA, so we sat for an hour and a half before boarding a 10-seater plane to Hilo. It was quite the experience, I must say.

In Hilo we hit up Walmart for more goodies and just spent the rest of the day in our hotel room at the Grand Naniloa. This place was very nice. The close parking requires valet, but we like to access our car a lot so we parked in the very spacious reserved lot just on the other side of the street.

Day 6:

**Volcanos National Park Day**! Before we headed out we caught the big Wednesday Farmer‚Äôs Market in Hilo, which had tons of local produce. On our way to the park we stopped at **Akatsuka Orchid Gardens**, which also happens to only be open Wednesdays and Fridays. This place is free to enter and browse all the crazy beautiful orchids they have.

Once at the park we spent some time through the gift shops, then walked through all of **Sulphur Banks** to the **Steam Vents** and back. Then we drove around, checking out the Kilauea Overlook on the north end, then going back down south to see the **Thurston Lava Tube** and drive the **Chain of Craters** all the way to the Sea Arch. We didn‚Äôt really make any stops on the actual road, but we did walk a ways east past the Sea Arch and found a cool field of iridescent lava rock. Maybe not worth the long hot walk but it was cool to see.

We headed back to Volcano village for dinner at the Lava Rock Caf√©, then headed back in to see the lava at night, first walking a little bit of **Devastation Trail**. This was a cool trail, I wish we had more time, energy, and better weather when we were there. We got to see some ‚ÄúPele‚Äôs Tears‚Äù in the gravel.

We headed to the eruption viewing area (a mile walk after parking) at about 5:30. The park ranger said it‚Äôd be crazy busy at sunset, and he was right. Luckily we got close parking but you gotta be patient and assertive to get a front row view of the lava. The park ranger also claimed people would clear out by 8:30 pm. This was not true lol, there were still plenty of people, albeit less than sunset. The live, glowing lava at night is super cool to see.

Hilo overall was very rainy and somewhat dreary. We picked this spot for easy access to Volcanos, but I see why it‚Äôs not a popular tourist spot. If I were to do it again I‚Äôd just stay a night in Volcano.

Day 7:

We originally considered driving to Green Sand Beach on the way to Kona, but we decided it was just too tough to get to and opted for a drive along the north coast with our Gypsy app instead. Unfortunately we missed breakfast today so we were a bit hangry during the road trip.

First we did a small tour loop through Hilo, seeing **Rainbow Falls** and **Boiling Pots**. Then we set north, stopping for the stupendous **Akaka Falls**. We also took a long detour to **Waipi‚Äôo Valley** **lookout**. This view was gorgeous, but we were a bit tired and hungry to truly appreciate it. After Waipi‚Äôo we followed our gypsy tour down through Waimea all the way to Kona, no stops.

We checked into Royal Kona at about 4:30 pm. The parking situation there was aggravating, but luckily there‚Äôs a cool dining district a few minutes‚Äô walk away so we had a lovely, cheap, ocean view dinner at Outback to calm us down.

Finally the reason we stayed a night in Kona‚Äîthe **midnight manta snorkel.** Our slot was at 10:10pm, and we both nearly dragged our feet there, we were so tired. But it was absolutely magical. Idk if it was the late time slot or a great group or pure luck, but we saw like at least 8 different manta rays, and at one point 3-4 were in view at once. They‚Äôre humongous, graceful creatures and swoop way up close to the paddle board you hold onto, literally within ‚Äúlicking distance‚Äù as our tour guy said. Worth every dang penny, this was an excellent time and a true finale to our trip.

Day 8:

This was a chill last day. Our flight didn‚Äôt leave until late so we took our time sleeping in, checking out, then using the Gypsy app to take an abridged tour of the **Kona Coffee Coast**. We got last-minute sunset drone shots at sunset at Old Kona Airport Beach before heading to the airport.",VisitingHawaii
1688311435.0,Be aware there is not an active eruption at this time,"Just posting this as a PSA due to the number of angry and ‚Äúmisled‚Äù people (seriously, one couple was lambasting a park ranger because they came all the way from Ohio to see lava and they demanded a tour to the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù eruption site like in the movie) and disappointed children we encountered. 

A lot of people have this notion that they‚Äôll be able to see lava floes spilling into the ocean and explosions in the sky. 

Nope. Not happening. Not since 2018.

1673940863.0,"Road to Hana, kind of underwhelming?","My partner and I just got back from driving the road to Hana all day, we did the whole thing short of coming around the back side of the mountain on the south; Paia to the gulch and pools of HaleakalƒÅ and back out from whence we came. We started at 7:30am, hit the black sand beach at 11:30 and got back to our spot by about 6:00. We were left, kind of underwhelmed, for lack of a better way of putting it. We get the the whole vibe is, ‚Äúit‚Äôs about the journey, not the destination‚Äù and it truly was beautiful! We did at least a couple of miles worth of hikes and we stopped at almost every stop on the gypsy tour with the exception of the garden of Eden because we wanted to do the other arboretum. The real highlights for us were Coconut Glen‚Äôs Ice Cream and Sandy‚Äôs (legit, an amazing loaf of banana bread). But the whole thing felt weird, like some mid-century Route 66 way of traveling that feels kind of like a tourist trap more than a worthwhile experience. The waterfalls were cool, the black sand beach was alright, the views could be stunning at times. But at the end of the day, the whole thing just felt kind of off and like a huge waste of time when there are so many of these things all over Hawai‚Äôi! No disrespect, we‚Äôre grateful for the experience, like I said it was beautiful. The drive wasn‚Äôt even nerve wracking or anxiety inducing for us; we navigated it with ease.

1660917828.0,9 days on Big Island with no car (REVIEW of how we did it)," In this post I will review the experience my friends and I had on the Big Island with no car rented of any sorts throughout our stay.  

This specifically will focus on what the Big Island was like with no car because I see many people ask about that ‚Äî just like we did ‚Äî and, for very good reason, receive affirmative ""don't come without a car, go to Oahu"" answers. I will describe our great experience here for anybody else focusing on this aspect. I will make a post for the things we did and food we ate, etc later.   
 

**Details**  

We are 19 year old males from Canada. We are physically active and fit.  

We were on the Big Island from the afternoon of 9 August to the morning of 18 August.   

We stayed for 2 days in Kona, and stayed for 7 days in Hilo.   

During our time on the Big Island, we also visited Waikoloa Beach, Hapuna Beach, and Waimea through the Hele-On Bus.  

**Big Island With No Car**  

Here's the thing ‚Äî I don't think visiting the Big Island without a car will be good for most people who frequent this subreddit. This is my main warning.  

Most people who comment in this subreddit, or visit Hawaii in general, are able to drive a car, afford a rental car, and also be able to rent a car legally in the first place. Unlike my friend and I.  

Not having a car means that you are either unable to visit some popular locations, or that you will have to book a tour in advance. For example, Mauna Kea and Green Sand Beach, and pretty much all of the nature reserves and coffee farms that are nestled away from towns. 

Getting around the island itself will require the Hele-On Bus, or an Uber/Lyft/taxi if you are willing to pay potentially high amounts to get between different towns (though within a town, say, Hilo, these prices are totally reasonable). 

If you are unable to get a rental car for whatever reason, I only recommend coming to the Big Island if you *really* want to visit it like we did and are okay with the above. My friend and I were aware we would miss out on some things and were fine with that. There were specific things on the Big Island we wanted to experience and we got that. 

**Hele-On Bus**  

Here's the main part of this post. This bus will be your main way of getting around the island if you have no car, unless you are content with staying in one place for your stay.  

It is currently FREE, even if it's a route that takes 4 hours to get across 3/4 of the island. Still free! 

Previous reviews of the Hele-On Bus have not been very positive on this subreddit or the previous one. However, we have pretty much only positive things to say about it. We used it every day during our stay except for one. There are some things to keep in mind though.  

1. The schedules are usually not followed very strictly. Be there 15-20 minutes early, expect to wait 15-20 minutes later. However, they do usually come. One time, a bus for the day was cancelled and we had to wait for the next one to come an hour later. Which brings me to‚Ä¶  

2. You can call them from their site and ask about the status of any bus. They will tell you if it is coming on time for now or if it is cancelled for the day. There is a slight bus shortage, so on most days around two lines have to be cancelled. For example, we never went to PƒÅhoa but on one day they were mentioning how that line was running to Hilo every 2 hours instead of every hour.  

Otherwise, the buses are largely comfortable. There are different models used ‚Äî the ones that go between towns are coach buses (like Greyhound) so you can sleep easily if you want to.  

The system is not made for tourists, and won't stop at any specific tourist destinations. It is primarily used by locals to get to work or get around in general. This was really good for me. While using the bus I met many people living on the Big Island who I talked to and learnt a lot about the island from. We talked about Hawaii, politics, family, and religion. Riding the bus was personally one of my favourite parts of the trip.  

Also ‚Äî it may not stop at any tourist destinations, but it drives through the beauty of the Big Island irregardless. If it's daytime, feel free to take photos of the Hamakua Coast, Saddle Road, Hilo rainforest, or wherever it is you drive by. 

And one more thing. If you plan to use the bus like, you are staying in Kona for a few nights and then want to switch to Hilo, then pack light. My friend and I only had one backpack each but if you have 3 big luggage carriers it'll be a pain and you'll be taking up space that local workers may need to use.

**Conclusion**  

It's not for everybody, but if you are a specific kind of tourist who wants to visit the Big Island and can't have a rental car then it is doable to visit it. Just be prepared!  

Also, here is the site for the Hele-On Bus where you can see where it goes and get contact information.

1659472633.0,[Oahu & Maui] Full review of our honeymoon to Hawaii,"[Edit: Linked a few pictures for your viewing pleasure.]

Hey everyone - Wife and I just got back from visiting Hawaii for the first time. I figured I'd share where we stayed and what we did in case others are looking for ideas, guidance, etc. 

Context: We're a young, married couple with no kids. We like to eat and drink. We *do* enjoy physical outdoor activities but *far* from being adrenaline junkies. Basically all of our rooms and airfare were booked with credit card points, so we splurged quite a bit on restaurants and activities.

**SUNDAY**

We arrived in Honolulu around 5pm local time, picked up our rental car from the airport and drove to our hotel at the Hyatt Place near **Waikiki Beach**. Despite being Hyatt loyalists, this one was pretty junky, to be honest. Probably the worst Hyatt property we've ever stayed at. Service was great as to be expected of Hyatt, but the property itself is just old and worn down. If you have the extra cash / points to spare, definitely book the Centric a few blocks down!

Neither of us really had any sort of preconceived notion as to what downtown Honolulu would be like, so we were sort of surprised by how touristy it was. It was honestly off-putting at first, because that's just not our vibe, and we were also probably very tired, cranky, and hungry after being in the air for 15 hours, but admittedly, downtown grew on us the longer we were there.

We spent the rest of the evening walking around **Kalakaua Avenue** which is where all the hustle and bustle was, frantically searching for any restaurant that would take us without a >1 hour wait. Even the PF Changs was like a 50-minute wait. Shame on us for not making a rez ahead of time. We finally got into **Kani Ka Pile Grille** which is the restaurant at the Outrigger Hotel, not really expecting much but it was actually a really fun time. Live band was great. And I finally got to try some [loco moco](https://i.ibb.co/2q97tF7/20220724-193520.jpg) which totally hit the spot after a long day of travel.

**MONDAY**

We started the day bright and early, got smoothies at the Sunrise Shack (5-minute walk from our hotel), then drove to **[Manoa Falls](https://i.ibb.co/FBznM2D/20220725-093158.jpg)** and hiked it all the way to the ""waterfall"" which itself was pretty disappointing lol. But some of the views were really gorgeous. Lots of cool plants and trees.

After hiking, we visited the **Mu-Ryang-Sa Korean Buddhist Temple**, about 15 minutes away. This might not be everyone's vibe, but for us, it was a really beautiful, serene experience. As we got there, there was a lone monk doing a bell meditation ritual in the temple. We walked around the property for about 15 minutes and just took it all in. We also got [a great view of Honolulu city from a cool POV](https://i.ibb.co/HPvrbdM/20220725-105900.jpg). It was just a really neat place to experience all by ourselves with no other tourists around.

After that, we drove about 20 minutes to the **Kailua Shopping Center** and went across the street to a small convenient store called The Hibachi and ordered [poke bowls and spam musubi](https://i.ibb.co/PctgBtw/20220725-115513.jpg) over the counter. This was SO much fun and super cost-effective. They only have a few tables out front, but you can walk down one block to Fat Boy's which had several open tables. So we just sat there and enjoyed our lunch.

From there, we walked around the corner to **Coffee Or Tea?** and I ordered some shave ice with green beans, azuki beans, taro root, etc. It was out of this world. We walked a little further down and did a free chocolate tasting at **Manoa Chocolate**, then rounded out our time there by returning to that shopping plaza and popping into a few gift shops. It was all very walkable.

After that, we drove back to Waikiki and relaxed for a bit at the hotel before we did the **[luau dinner at the Royal Hawaiian](https://i.ibb.co/L6Hmjyt/20220725-183246.jpg)**. I'm going to be completely honest - I had very low expectations. In my research, some people said a luau is a must, others said it's a complete waste of money. Having lived in NYC, I try to be cognizant and avoid the typical tourist traps. This luau at the Royal Hawaiian, though, was incredible. The show itself was from 5pm to 8pm. Plenty of food and drinks. Performance was top-notch. Also, the one Hawaiian dude from White Lotus was a performer in the show lol. My wife recognized him immediately (hmmm, I wonder why...) and pointed him out. We got a picture together afterwards.

**TUESDAY**

This was our big **North Shore** day. We got acai bowls for breakfast at Hale-iwa Bowls and then drove a little further to Shark's Cove for some snorkeling. This was our first time snorkeling, *ever*, so it was quite an adventure. We saw some beautiful fish and even a big sea turtle! We did this for about 1.5 hours. We didn't have anywhere else to be, just felt like that was enough time for us.

After snorkeling, we drove about 5 minutes down the road to Haleiwa and did a bunch of shopping, just walking around, going from store to store. (More of my wife's thing, not really my thing.) It's basically just one very, VERY long strip of stores. There was plenty to see. We stopped along the way at the legendary **Matsumoto Shave Ice**. I got the [Ichiban Special which was an absolute monstrosity](https://i.ibb.co/x8hTRpf/20220726-125328.jpg) - your choice of flavor topped with condensed milk, red bean paste, mochi balls, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, all served on a waffle boat. It was...incredible.

After North Shore, we drove to **Helena's** for a late lunch / early dinner. The [Menu D was the one that had a little bit of everything](https://i.ibb.co/vQ9y75C/20220726-152335.jpg), so we ordered that with a few extra things like mac salad. I wanted to go to at least one place that served authentic Hawaiian food and, by all accounts, this was *the* spot to check out. Maybe I overhyped it for myself, because it was a little disappointing to be honest. Food was totally fine / good, just did not meet my really high expectations.

Then we just went back to the hotel and passed out for the night.

**WEDNESDAY**

This was our last morning in Honolulu / Waikiki before we flew out to Maui, so we agreed to each pick one place to visit.

Mine was *Zippy's**. Yo. Let me tell you. This place was more my speed. I ordered a Zip Pac Deluxe and just chowed down. Consider me a Zippy's fan for life. I can't wait until they open one in the States.

After Zippy's, my wife took us to **Leonard's Bakery** for [some malasadas](https://i.ibb.co/6rvRQZT/20220727-081120.jpg). These were pretty good too! My wife said, ""Best donuts I've ever had in my life"" - but I feel like maybe she was just caught up in the ecstasy of the moment. If you're into donuts / fried pastries, definitely check them out.

From here, we went to the airport and took a 20-minute flight over to Maui. Before we even checked into our hotel, we made a stop at **Maui Brewing Company** for lunch, because we were told we ""have to"". It was just OK. Just shared the fish tacos (meh, could do better at home). Beer was pretty good.

We stayed at the **Andaz** resort and that was really something to behold. Neither of us had stayed at a 5-star hotel before, so the Andaz really [just...blew us away](https://i.ibb.co/xzSXSKn/20220727-172952.jpg). The entire property, service, views, amenities...everything was so incredible. Cannot recommend it enough, ESPECIALLY for couples.

We unpacked into our rooms and got drinks downstairs by the pool at the **Lehua Lounge**, then got dinner at **Monkeypod**. I was very tipsy by the time we got to dinner, but I have to say, Monkeypod really met my very high expectations. I was afraid it would fall into the trap of Helena's, and I would be disappointed, but happy to report this was not the case. Cocktails and food were exceptional. 

**THURSDAY**

We woke up bright and early and did a **snorkeling excursion with the Pride of Maui**. They took us out on a [charter boat to Molokini Crater](https://i.ibb.co/7tfM4rY/20220728-090127.jpg). It's one hour to get to the Crater, an hour there, then another stop to nearby Turtletown, then an hour back to the dock. So, five hours total.

This was very pricey at about $500 for the both of us, but that seems to be the going rate for this kind of excursion. Unfortunately, my wife got really seasick and had a miserable time. But even if she didn't get sick, I feel like it still would have been disappointing consider the cost of entry. The water by the crater was not as clear as I was hoping, and we didn't really see any cool fish or even any turtles in Turtletown, for that matter. Major, major letdown. I'd highly advise against doing this sort of thing unless you just have money to blow.

The operation itself (again, Pride of Maui) was really great, though. They took really good care of us, made a ginger drink (with fresh ginger) for my wife after she got sick. Very great with the guests, helping them get their gear on, etc.

Afterwards, we went back to the resort and relaxed for a bit before driving about one hour north to **Lahaina**. In our research, it seemed like there were so many great places to eat in Lahaina, so I was a bit annoyed that it was so far away. We spent all of these CC points to stay at such a nice resort so it didn't make much sense for us to schedule things so far away.

With that said, I think Lahaina is definitely worth visiting at least for a whole afternoon or evening. PLENTY of places to shop. The stores were never-ending, and it's all along one strip, so it's very walkable. We got some Dole Whip ice cream and more shave ice before winding down with dinner at **Lahaina Grill**. Let me say, service here was absolutely top-notch. Our server (woman with short hair, I'm so annoyed that we didn't remember her name) really did a phenomenal job. Food was great, too. 

**FRIDAY**

Last full day in Hawaii. :(

We walked out to the beach part of our resort first thing in the morning and did some more snorkeling. We weren't expecting to see much, and we really didn't, but just wanted to do it one more time before we packed away our gear. After that, we just laid by the pool, ordered food and drinks (all served poolside!) and just relaxed.

We drove out to **Zippy's** one more time at my request for lunch lol. We got [a LOT of food this time](https://i.ibb.co/RCq8dnp/20220729-141826.jpg) and shared everything. We ordered the Hawaiian plate (only served on Fridays), Zip Min, and Korean chicken platter.

Went back to the resort and relaxed, then went to dinner at **[Spago at Four Seasons](https://i.ibb.co/z7Pppdb/20220729-181350.jpg)**. Despite being less than a mile down the road, it's quite a long, winding walk - about 40-45 minutes, we were told - so we just took the resort's courtesy car. Spago was really great. Food and service, like Lahaina Grill, was excellent. But I feel like we overdid it at Zippy's and weren't as hungry as we needed to be for Spago. Totally our fault, but...I regret nothing.

A few quick hitters:

* Favorite meal: Zippy's, BY A MILE. Followed by Lahaina Grill.

* Favorite activity: Snorkeling in Shark's Cove in North Shore, Oahu.

* Favorite off-the-beaten path thing: Just ordering poke bowl over the counter and having a quiet lunch outside.

* Most beautiful sight: Eating dinner at Spago and watching the sunset behind the island of Lanai. Just breathtaking. But also heartbreaking because it was our last night.

* Best money spent: This is sort of cheating, but all of the money we spent racking up credit card points to be able to stay at the Andaz Maui for free!

* ""I regret spending money on this"": $500 snorkeling excursion

* ""Totally do this one thing if you're visiting Hawaii for the first time"": A really good luau. It's going to be expensive, but just do it. I'm on the luau wagon now.

* Biggest surprise: I was SO sure we'd enjoy Maui more than Oahu. Despite being able to stay at a world-class resort in Maui, I have to say, I think we enjoyed our time more in Oahu. We just did more *stuff* there. No hour felt wasted. So much fun. Maui was beautiful, but I felt like you had to drive 45-60 minutes to get anywhere interesting. Lots of long stretches of unremarkable land. Granted, we didn't go *too* far from our resort. We'd probably change our tune if we visited different parts of the island or did the Road to Hana.

In summary - many, many thanks to everyone on this sub (and the old one) for providing so many great suggestions during our many nights of planning and research. We had so much fun, and we can't wait to come back.",VisitingHawaii

I realize the beach closure is necessary for the protection of the mother and baby Monk Seals, I  just wish the hotel had been more transparent about the complete lack of beach access, or made some type of effort to compensate its guests (IE shuttle to other beaches, meal vouchers‚Ä¶.anything to make the disappointment of paying for a ‚Äúbeachfront‚Äù hotel with no beach or pool a little less painful.)

1651075902.0,Tourist's Tour and Review of Mostly Waikiki Restaurants (Long),"(Originally posted this in /r/Honolulu didn't realize this sub existed... this sub would have been really handy to know about a week earlier, but hopefully this helps others!)

Just wrapped up a week's stay at Waikiki... we had a great time  and I wanted to write down some experiences about the restaurants we went to both for my own notes as well as for any other tourists who might be coming to Waikiki. I'm not sure if it's just the Hawaii air or what, but almost all the food we ate was spectacular.

Background: family of 4 with two kids ages 11 and 13 and fairly price insensitive.  The kids have a pretty diverse palette but in the end they are still kids.  This review will be through that lens.  YMMV! We were here four years ago, pre-COVID, and we wanted to come back to Waikiki for all the outdoor activities and dining. This is through the lens of a tourist -- unfortunately I had no inside information or local contacts, so we chose the restaurants based on online reviews which sometimes have questionable objectivity.

Star ratings are more stingy than I would give on yelp (where restaurants live and die on ratings).  I have a breakdown of my ratings at the end. While I'm pretty price insensitive for trying new restaurants, I do keep in mind price for repeat visits, so some restaurants may have a different price-adjusted rating than initial rating.

&#x200B;

Saturday:

[Maragume Udon](https://www.marugameudon.com/)

Rating: 4 stars (5 stars price-adjusted)

Logistical Notes: walk-in, short line, went in off-hours

Repeat visit from our last trip.  Love the fresh noodles, and the price value proposition is very high. The line moves quickly so you usually don't have to wait too long.  I'd probably come back a different time if the line goes around the corner though if you have any flexibility.

&#x200B;

Sunday:

[Paia Fish Market](https://paiafishmarket.com/best-seafood-waikiki-oahu/)

Rating: 3 stars

Logistical Notes: walk-in, no line, went a bit early

Everything was ok, but nothing was stand-out.  Food was kind of one-note.  Pasta had a ton of butter. We walked past it at a later time and there was a huge line though, so evidently some people like it a lot.

[Zigu](http://www.zigu.us/)

Rating: 5 stars

Logistical Notes: walk-in, no line

Loved all the food and our server was great.  Kids especially liked Zigu and wanted to go back. We have a favorite Izakaya restaurant locally, so it was great to check this one out.

&#x200B;

Monday:

[Sato Seafood](https://www.instagram.com/satoseafood808/)

Rating: 4 stars

Logistical Notes: walk-in, no line, only 1 table (mostly take-out), small menu

Fish was fresh and dishes well seasoned.  I especially liked the rice, which is often an afterthought back home.  Only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is there aren't a lot of items on the menu.  Great to go to once though.

[Thai Issan Waikiki](https://thaiissanwaikiki.com/)

Rating: 5 stars

Logistical Notes: walk-in, no line

Leftovers are often a good indicator of how good a restaurant is because some of the tricks you can use to make food taste better at the restaurant fall apart the next day. We had some seafood panang curry leftover.  After re-heating the seafood still tasted fresh and cooked perfectly, and the curry was possibly better than the first time around.  Would be happy to go to this restaurant on a regular basis.

Tuesday:

[Heavenly Island Lifestyle](https://www.heavenly-waikiki.com/)

Rating: 5 stars

Logistical Notes: walk-in

Repeat visit from last trip.  Food quality was great, and love the vibe of the place.

[Aracino Di Mare](https://www.arancino.com/arancino-di-mare)

Rating: 5 stars

Logistical Notes: reserved through OpenTable a few nights prior

Repeat visit from last trip. We try not to repeat restaurant visits on a single trip, but this would have been my vote for a restaurant worth a second visit on the same trip. Pasta was fresh and superb and there are tons of dishes I want to try. This is definitely a restaurant we would go to regularly if it were at home.

Wednesday:

[Hihimanu Sushi](https://www.hihimanusushi.com/)

Rating: 5 stars (4 stars price-adjusted)

Logistical Notes: reserved through OpenTable a few nights prior, used Uber

Loved all the dishes. Our sous-chef either enjoyed interacting with my kids or hid his displeasure well. They had some add-ons which we tried. Even though I'm pretty price insensitive, it's expensive enough for me that I can't see myself going to it on a regular basis despite how good the food was.

[Herringbone](https://taogroup.com/venues/herringbone-waikiki/)

Rating: 4 stars (3.5 stars price-adjusted)

Logistical Notes: booked through web-site day of

Not too sure on this rating because it had hard competition coming on the heels of Hihimanu Sushi. The food was solid, but at the price point I'm not sure I would recommend it if you are price sensitive.

Thursday:

[Tim Ho Wan](https://www.royalhawaiiancenter.com/tim-ho-wan)

Rating: 4.5 stars

Logistical Notes: walk-in, no line

We initially tried to go to [Cream Pot](https://creampothawaii.com/), but it was unexpectedly closed for the day, so we ended up here.  I usually order a shrimp gau as a comparator among dim sum restaurants as it's almost always on the menu, and it's easy to mess up either the shrimp itself (overcooked, underseasoned) or the wrapper (bad texture, chalky, etc).  This was among the best shrimp gau I've ever had.  The rest of the dishes were great too.  Only down-side to being in a regular restaurant rotation is the menu selection wasn't as wide as I would like.

[Zigu](http://www.zigu.us/)

Rating: 5 stars

Logistical Notes: booked through OpenTable night before

I'm of the philosophy that kids get such little agency in their lives, when it's not too inconvenient (but not so often they become spoiled of course) it's good to let them have a say in the matter.  If we were going to go back to a restaurant on this trip, I would have preferred Aracino, but one of my kids specifically asked to go back to Zigu.  Given that they had little choice in any of our other restaurant choices, I decided it was fine to go back.

We had a couple repeat dishes but mostly tried new ones, and everything was great.  The staff were friendly even remembered us from our previous trip!

Friday

[Fresco Italian Restaurant](https://www.hiltonhawaiianvillage.com/dining/fresco-italian-restaurant)

Rating: 3 stars

Logistical Notes: walk-in

We first tried to go to Cream Pot again, but the line was too long, so we went with our back-up plan of [Aloha Kitchen](https://alohakitchenhawaii.wixsite.com/alohakitchenwaikiki).  Unfortunately that line was also long and my kids were starving, so we ended up at Fresco Italian Restaurant. This was the first restaurant of the week I thought to myself ""tourist trap."" Still, our server was both friendly and adept, though the place looked under-staffed as brunch took longer than it should have.  Food was fine, but pretty mundane for that price point.

[Chef Chai](https://chefchai.com/)

Rating: 5 stars

Logistical Notes: booked through OpenTable earlier in the week, used Uber

There was a tasting menu available that had a sampler of 5 different appetizers, and a choice each of entree and dessert... and amazingly all of them hit our taste profile. We all chose the tasting menu, and I ordered an appetizer of escargot, shrimp, and mushrooms since the kids had never had escargot before.  Everything was great! Despite a fairly large amount of price insensitivity, it's hard to justify spending this amount of money on a regular basis for a meal, but Chef Chai is worth it -- it is probably the most expensive restaurant that has made the regular rotation list.

&#x200B;

We had to leave the next day, so those were all of the restaurants we were able to try.  We also found some nice markets I wanted to remember.  I'm not sure if they are corporate or family-owned, but they are less ""commercial"" than some of the other markets:

[https://www.yelp.com/biz/236-grocery-honolulu](https://www.yelp.com/biz/236-grocery-honolulu)

This one definitely seemed family owned.  It's small but they stock a lot for the space.  They also had small packages of spices and other things you might use if you were cooking.

[https://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-mini-mart-honolulu](https://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-mini-mart-honolulu)

This one might be family owned? Had a stick of butter, which was surprisingly hard to find... this store was the only store in walking distance we found that had real butter.

[https://www.instagram.com/p/Cclop1dPuZp/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cclop1dPuZp/)

This particular store location has almost no internet footprint it looks like! I did find a website for the mothership (Palama Supermarket) and it sounds like while it's a chain, it's still a local one.

&#x200B;

All-in-all we had a great time. Everyone was friendly and it was nice to just chill and relax! I know this is a long post, but it's both for me to remember the next time I'm there, and hopefully helpful to any tourist looking for a place to eat.

Star reference:

5 stars - A restaurant I would go to regularly.  Would recommend friends go there.

4 stars - A restaurant I thought was great, but for some reason probably wouldn't go to regularly. Would be happy to eat there if a friend suggested we go there. Would recommend to a friend to try.

3 stars - A restaurant I thought was fine.  Would be willing to go there if a friend wanted to go there, but probably wouldn't recommend it as there are better options around.

2 stars - A mediocre restaurant. Would not return and would suggest friends stay away from

1 star - Something really bad happened here",VisitingHawaii
1700262424.0,Here's a recap of my trip this past week.,"We flew hawaiian airlines. The comfort seats were worth it. My husband is 6'3 and he still had about 3 inches of leg room for his knees. 

We used thrifty car rental, and I wished I had read the reviews before hand. When I got to the rental counter, I kid you not, there were about 60 people in line. It took an hour of waiting to get my car. When I went downstairs to get it the employees were basically just giving people any car, no matter what size you reserved. They ran out of small midsized.They gave us the option of dodge charger or Chevy spark. I WISH I GOT THE SPARK. It would have been much easier to drive and park everything was so small. 

Our Airbnb was beautiful, but the garage was a hassle. Garage had dead ends that you had to carefully back out of if there were no available spaces. People driving in and out of the garage also would cause dead standstill traffic on the street.

We landed at 2:30 friday, but with the car rental, traffic, etc, we got to the airbnb around 5. We went to the American wagyu food truck and went to Kapiolani park beach to eat and watch the fireworks. We then ate dinner at Aloha Melt. This was the best part of the day, they made damn good grilled cheeses. We spent the rest of the night walking around waikiki, which seems more fun at night. To be honest, this first day was awful.

The next day was much better. We went to the Kaka'ako farmers market. I wanted to eat at Little Sparrow, which is a Sp√§tzle fusion place. I think that was my favorite meal in Hawaii. Then we walked around, got Dole whip, and hung out at the beach for a bit. We went to Salt at our Kaka'ako, we had Hanks Haute hot dogs, which were okay. Then we had gelato at 7gradi gelato, which was amazing. The ube and riso flavors were my favorite. From here we drove to Foster's botanical garden. I loved this place. I felt so small next to the giant trees. I really loved it and highly recommend. We drove back to waikiki and walked around a bit, then ate at Topped Waikiki, a bibimbap place. This was my least favorite thing I ate in Hawaii. We stopped at dukes for pastries. The canelle and ube roll were delicious.

Sunday morning we had a circle island tour with go Hawaii tours. This was my least favorite thing we did on the trip. It was mostly sitting on the bus, then having to rush at every place we stopped. We also didn't go to all the places due to a marathon, ect. We weren't able to go to diamond head, or the Makapu‚Äòu lighthouse, we stopped at halona blowhole, stopped at a beach to watch sea turtles, went to a local Macadamia nut farm but they didnt have any coffee to try or purchase, fruit stands, China man's hat, Tanaka shrimp truck, which was flavorless and rubbery, sunset Beach but we couldn't go down toward the water, Dole plantation, which was a total tourist trap, and Byodo Inn which was the only good place we visited. After we walked around waikiki, we ate dinner at Guava Smoked, had boba and Junbi, walked around more before heading home for the night. 

Monday, I ate my first acai bowl at Waffle and Berry and I am now hooked. They also had amazing waffles. We went to diamond head to hike up the top and I discovered I love hiking. We were hungry after so went to Cafe Kalia, which had very fresh brunch and breakfast food. Then we went to Manoa falls. This was a beautiful hike through the rainforest. BRING MOSQUITO SPRAY!  I forgot mine at the airbnb and didn't wanna pay 15 dollars for one at the gate, so ended up getting eaten alive the first 5 minutes. We reached the falls, but due to the drought Hawaii had been having there wasn't much of a waterfall, but was beautiful nonetheless. The way back I made a turn to go Aihualama trail. THIS WAS NOT FOR NOVICES. We had to turn back because we thought we were gonna get lost in the woods and it was getting dark, but I had so much fun and I felt like an adventurer. We were so done after these 3 hikes. We had walked about 10 miles that day. We ate at pit stop burgers for dinner. 

Tuesday we went to Aroma Cafe. I had another acai bowl, which was amazing. Then we had coffee and pastries at Kona Coffee Purveyors. Line was long, but it went quick. I totally get the hype tho. The coffee was super good and so were the pastries. The banana Nutella croissant was incredible. We headed toward Kualoa ranch, but stopped at Ho'omaluhia botanical garden. It was lovely here as well. We did the novice Ebike tour. I LOVED THIS TOUR SO MUCH. Daryl was our guide and our group was small. Only 2 other couples besides us. It was raining and windy, but I had so much fun, he was a great and fun guide, and the views were so beautiful. Then we called ahead and ordered at Adelas country eatery. This was the sweetest lady ever. I got the ube noodles with pork, brisket and green beans, and 2 ube Cheesecake slices. It came out to about $75, but worth it to me. The noodles were delicious and the cheesecake was to die for. 

Wednesday we went to the swap meet. It was okay, a lot of stands had similar things, but I got a few nice gifts here for way cheaper than in Waikiki. I forgot to visit Pearl Harbor and didn't realize until the flight home. After the Swap meet we ate at Munch and Brunch, which was very tasty. Then we went to Hanauma Bay. I can't swim, but I saw some fish without snorkeling and the life vest helped a lot. I will have to practice with a snorkel more. I rented one but wasn't able to do it due to my anxiety. I let my husband use it and he saw a lot of fish. Definitely need water shoes for this. I know not to step on the reef but further down there were lots of rocks in toward the shore and I got a lot of cuts. I would Def do this again but try a different part of the beach. We went at 1230, but when we left at 2:30 the beach started getting empty, so I would try a later reservation next time. After this we wanted to do Koko head trail, but it looked way too steep and we were kinda tired. We went to Makapu‚Äòu lighthouse trail instead. THE VIEWS AT THE TOP WERE BREATHTAKING. I seriously think those were the best views on Oahu. Then we walked down to the tidepools. They were beautiful. After, we ate at beastside kitchen. Then I got boba from CowCows tea.  

Had my last acai bowl Thursday before heading to the airport. Car rental drop off was much easier. Only took 5 minutes.

I was definitely glad we got a car to get out of waikiki, because it was beautiful. I would skip the circle tour and use Shaka tours and drive around myself. Next time I will get the smallest car possible. I wish I had more time to chill on the beach, and wish I tried more Hawaiin food. I should have carried my umbrella with me.

Saturday 3/11 - Kailua Kona
Arrived to the Big Island. We got great advice on where to go/what to do from our lyft driver. We got to the My Hawaii hostel and changed and then took an Uber to Umekes in Kailua Kona.  A great place to go when jetlagged - our bartender was super nice. We got poke and Virgin Pina Coladas. The poke was like butter - melted in my mouth. Then we took a lyft back to the hostel and crashed.

Sunday 3/12 - Kailua Kona
We woke up and Ubered to the catholic church (St. Josephs) for mass. After that we bought sunscreen (reef safe) and walked around Kailua Kona (mainly tourist shops). Highly recommend Scandinavian Shave Ice- our lyft driver told us to get it with Lillikoi and Watermelon flavor and then Tahitian vanilla in the middle. For lunch we walked to Willis hot Chicken. This place was great - has live music some nights and had a line out the door with mostly locals going there. We had a great conversation with an 80 year old filipina woman and navy vet who were world travelers but lived on the Big Island. After that we went to Target to meet our Mauna Kea Summit and Stars tour guide but we found out our tour was canceled due to inclement weather. So we ate shamrock shake oreo mcflurries while we decided what to do. We decided to reschedule the tour for our last day on the island and buy some swimsuits and dinner at Target and take an Uber to the nearest beach (airport beach).We hung out at the beach and watched the sun set. Not a great beach to swim at but great for sunsets. Then we took an Uber to downtown Kailua Kona and watched a hawaiian band play for 2 hours and had lots of drinks at Gertrudes. If you're looking for great entertainment while visiting, highly recommend. They have live music almost every night of the week and of many different genres!

Monday 3/13 - Kailua Kona
We hung around and met some of the people at the hostel for an hour. Then we went to a convenience store for some lunch food and then took an Uber to Kua Bay beach. I tried to swim but the waves were too strong for me but my cousin loved the water.  Overall though a pretty nice beach! Then we took an Uber to get our rental car. We picked up the rental and went to get sushi for dinner at Sushi Cocoro & Udon noodle in downtown Kailua Kona. Highly recommend going here. Amazing sushi for relatively cheap pricing. We then got shave ice again from Scandinavian shave ice (had to) and then drove to Walmart to pick up souvenirs and food for the next day. Highly recommend going go Walmart for souvenirs. They're cheap and they have an entire section for them near the entrance.

Tuesday 3/14 - Kailua Kona area
We woke up and drove our car to the Painted Church early to see that and get some pics. Next we drove to Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historic Site. We loved learning about the cultural significance, fabulous views and playing Konane. Then we ate a pb and banana sandwich lunch in the picnic area in the park and walked around some of the lava rocks and small tide pools. After that we drove up to Heavenly Hawaiian Kona Coffee Farm on the side of the mountain. We sampled many coffees and had a tour with Nate from Nebraska. Kona coffee is incredibly fruity and delicious. After that we drove to Costco to get gas and some groceries. We then ate a quick dinner at the hostel and then went to the Sea Paradise catamaran to go to the Manta Ray Night Dive. That was amazing and worth it to go on a big boat since they had better lighting equipment than the smaller boats which attracted the Mantas for longer. The staff was also super professional and amazing. Mantas were of course mesmerizing and huge!

Wednesday 3/15 - Kailua Kona -> Volcano
We woke up, checked out of our hostel and went to Two Step to snorkel. We saw yellow fish, sea urchins, rainbow parrot fish, and dolphins swimming in the bay. If you going to snorkel at all on the island, go as early as possible. By 11 am the best fish are hiding and the crowds have arrived. We had lunch again at the same picnic area next to Pu'uhonua O Honaunau park. Next we drove south and stopped at Punaluu bakery for some malasadas. My favorite was the Haupia and my cousins was the Lillikoi. Lots of tourists were also stopped there. Next we stopped at Punaluu black sand beach. This beach was super cool. We saw 4 or 5 turtles in the surf eating algae but none up on the beach. Also a ton of tourists here with some of them getting too close to the turtles. Then we stopped at Ka'u coffee mill to buy coffee and souvenirs. Next we stopped quickly at a general store for some ramen and butter mochi to try. We checked into our really nice airbnb in Volcano and ate ramen for dinner. 

Thursday 3/16 - Volcano
We woke up and drove over to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. We stopped at the visitors center, saw the huge active volcanic crater, saw the Thurston Lava Tube and then many other craters on the way down to the ocean on chain of craters road. Recommend the HVNP Shaka Guide tour. It was entirely worth it because it told us which stuff was worth seeing and gave us the background/ history  behind it. We did a really hot hike to see some petroglyphs and finally saw the sea arch at the end. We then drove out of the park. We were in the park for about 6 hours so allow enough time for this spectacular place. We then showered and then got ready for our nice dinner at Volcano House. We watched the sunset over the Volcano and behind Mauna Loa. The food and service were great (especially the fish dishes!). We then went to the Kiluea Overlook and didn't see lava flowing but saw more stars than we've ever seen before!

Friday 3/17 - Volcano
I woke up early (6:45) and went on a 2 hour hike down into the Kiluea Iki Crater and out. Amazing views and worth it to get up early to avoid the heat and crowds. After that we decided to do our laundry at the laundromat.  We got a late lunch at the Tuk Tuk Thai food truck which was good! The shrimp in the Pad Thai perfectly cooked and super fresh. After that we did a short hike to see the Sulfur Banks which is where sulfur steam is coming out in HVNP. After that we went to Volcano Winery and liked every single wine we tasted so we both bought a bottle to take home. They close at 5:30 daily so make sure you arrive with an hour to spare if you want to do a tasting. We then went back to our Airbnb for dinner (ramen and leftovers) and watched 2 hours of documentaries about the Hawaii Volcanoes.

Saturday 3/18 - Hilo
We woke up and drove to Hilo. We walked through the Liluokalani Japanese Gardens and then shopped at lots of the stores (shoutout Simply Sisters boutique for authentically hawaiian made clothing) We had a great time wandering through the farmers market and trying a bunch of foods. We bought a jam from Steve's Akaka Falls Jams which is one of the tents. You have to stop here - they will give you 10 samples and all are good. We then drove over to Ken's Pancakes for a late lunch. I had the Loco Moco and my cousin had the Mahi Mahi with eggs and hash browns and we split an order of pancakes. Pretty good but no A/C there which made it pretty hot inside since it was already after 1pm. Next we drove to Big Island Candies for some good edible souvenirs. After that we went to the Hawaii Bioreserve which we loved and saw so many amazing flowers! We did get bit by mosquitoes though. We then went to the catholic church for 5pm mass. After that we went to Hilo Burger (really enjoyed the laid back bar vibe but with good food) and headed back to the airbnb.

Sunday 3/19 - Hilo -> Waikoloa Village
We checked out of our airbnb and stopped at a 7/11 for some hawaiian snacks. Really loved the variety of snacks there. Next we went to Akaka Falls to check that out which was pretty cool! We stopped at the Honomu Goat Farm on the way out of Akaka Falls to feed some goats. They also sold carmels there which are AMAZING. Next we drove up to Waipio Valley overlook for a good view of the valley and ate our lunch in the car there. After that we drove to Pu'ukohala Heiau. Here the history of the site is more interesting than the site itself but regardless is very important in the history of King Kamehameha and the unification of the hawaiian people. Next we drove to the Fairmont Orchid to walk through it and see what it is like for half an hour. After that we drove to shower and check into our new airbnb in Waikoloa village. We drove to Mauna Lani Auberge to walk around the grounds (GORGEOUS) and hangout during sunset. Then we ate at Canoehouse for a 7:30 dinner which was phenomenal. Exhausted, we drove back to our airbnb.

Monday 3/20 - Kohala Coast / Mauna Kea
We woke up and drove to Hapuna Beach for a few hours. The beach was beautiful with a long expanse of fine white sand and great waves to boogie board in. We changed and drove to the Kailua Kona target to meet our Mauna Kea Summit and Stars tour guide and van. He drove us up to the visitors center and up the rough road to the summit with all of the telescopes. There was snow up there and even people skiing and snowboarding! We watched the sun set. Then we drove down to a lower elevation to look at the stars. It was so fun to be above the clouds and we were really glad we paid to have somebody else drive us up the rocky route to the summit. It felt like we were on Mars! We then drove back to the visitors center and then back to the Kona Target. We got back to the Kona Target right before 10pm so if you are doing one of these tours prepare for a long day.

Tuesday 3/21 - Kohala Coast -> Departure
We woke up and checked out of our airbnb. We spent the morning and early afternoon at Beach 69 which was great because it had lots of shade and very clear waters to see fish. It ended up being our favorite beach from the whole trip. We returned our rental and lastly stopped at Broke Da Mouth Grindz (had to get some Kalua Pork before leaving) for dinner before heading to the airport. 


If we had any regrets it would be staying at Waikoloa Village for one more day and Kailua Kona one less day since it would've given us more beach time. Other than that we both loved the trip and can't wait to return.

Still not sure which part of the island I liked better as both were there own, awesome experience!  Definitely recommend doing both sides if you have the time/ability to!

Kauai is such an amazing place - there were times the scenic views seemed photoshopped or painted on they were so great - and all the locals we interacted with were so nice.  Mahalo for letting us visit your island!

* Waimea Canyon is a must.  I echo others' recommendation to do the Shaka self-guided tour for this; it was helpful, cool to hear Hawaiian stories on the drive and worth paying for.  Be sure to plan enough time to be at the top by mid-morning.  We were told the clouds usually roll in around 11, blocking the view of the seaside part of the canyon, and sure enough they did.  We did the Pihue trail at the top; if you want awesome views of the canyon, you only need to do about the first 1/2 mile but it starts to get muddy after that.  I went all the way to the peak but the clouds blocked the entire view by the time I got there.
* Na Pali Coast boat tour is another must.  We used Captain Andy's and had a great experience.  The crew was amazing and went out of their way to make sure everyone was comfortable and took pictures for everyone.
* Secret Falls Kayak and Hike - we used Ali'i Kayaks and had a great experience.  Its about 2 miles of kayaking and 1 mile of ""hiking"" (really walking on a boardwalk most of the way) each way.  The guide explained a lot of things on the walk which was cool.  Definitely recommend but its obviously not a ""secret"" anymore as it was packed once we got to the falls.  Most people didn't get in the water though so there plenty of room in the pool and to get under the falls.
* Botanical Gardens - for the plants lovers.. we did McBryde (South) and Limahuli (North).  We'd only do Limahuli again.  McBryde is also a 3 hour time commitment for those unaware - its a 20 minute bus ride to the garden from the visitor center then they don't pick you back up for 2 hours.

**South Shore**

***Grand Hyatt -*** incredible hotel and property, would definitely recommend and we will be returning in the future.  The pools were fun, it was nice having the Heritage trail right outside your room to take a walk in the mornings.  Shipwreck Beach was also a blast as it wasn't crowded, had plenty of shade cover and the shore break waves were a rush to be in.

* For anyone interested in the club lounge rooms, the food was bland and we ended up not using it much but it does guarantee you (I believe) a ocean view room in the club lounge wing.  The ocean view alone was worth it but it does make for a far walk to the pools on the opposite side of the property, FYI.  Would consider a solid deal if on a budget and trying to minimize food expenses though.
* Tidepools lived up to the hype
* Stevenson's had great sushi and was one of my favorite meals of the trip
* Ill Alma's breakfast on the menu was great but the buffet was just okay

***Food***

* Konohiki Seafoods - amazing poke, perfect first meal after arriving in Lihue
* Ishihara Market - I was really excited about this place as it seemed the most recommended place to get poke but sadly our poke was tough.  We arrived right before 3 and they were low on poke so assuming we got the bad cuts saved for the last batch; will try again when we return earlier in the day
* Kiawe Roots - great Hawaiian/Texas BBQ fusion, one of our favorite meals - charming place and great service too
* Keoki's - cool place, our waitress was really nice and good drinks - food was dry and bland though
* Brennecke's Beach Broiler - fun place, good drinks and good food
* Dim 'N' Den Sum - awesome dim sum
* Koloa Pizza Kitchen + Bar - good pizza

**North Shore**

We stayed in an AirBnB condo in Princeville, was nice and quiet.  Wish there was somewhere to stay in Kilauea as the vibes there were much more relaxed than Hanalei but guessing the reason for that is because tourists can't really stay there!

***Food***

* Kilauea Fish Market - so good we ate here twice - poke, BBQ chicken and fish tacos were all amazing
* Kilauea Bakery/Pizzeria - the breakfast stromboli was awesome, wish we had made it back to try their pizza because the bread was so good
* Big Nick's - solid classic burger and the fries were great, the (I assume) owners were super nice too
* Palate Wine Bar & Restaurants - cute small wine bar, pizza and salad were both good
* Hanalei Poke - amazing poke, probably my favorite poke of the trip
* Bar Acuda - had to wait about an hour without a reservation but was worth it, all of our tapas were great
* Hanalei Bread Co. - great breakfast, expect a wait though - there was a line before it even opened
* Holey Grail Donuts - I'm not a donut guy but wow, these were amazing - the cashier was so nice too",VisitingHawaii
1697662674.0,Kauai October 2023 - Reviews,"Hello everyone, 

We just got back from Kauai and I wanted to share some of the spots we visited, where we stayed, what we enjoyed, and what we would recommend. At the bottom is a link to some pictures. I am not a professional photographer so please go easy on me, on the boat it's also quite difficult to take straight shots on the ocean lol.  It's just to give an idea of the beauty of this incredible place.

1. Royal Sonesta 8.5/10- We stayed here as part of a Costco package, we got $150 hotel credit as part of the package and used it at the Kukui restaurant on site, they also gave us two free glasses of champagne since we were there for our anniversary which was very nice, we don't drink but the gesture was kind either way. The hotel staff was very kind. The bartenders you generally have to order through at the Kukui are not so much, they generally ignore you if you do not drink alcohol and just want to order food, this was a common theme, it's a common theme everywhere we go so it's not a knock, it's just kinda shitty since we stopped drinking 3 years ago that if we don't buy alcohol we get kinda pushed to the side at most places. Kukuis food was better than expected though. The hotel itself was clean, the beach is right there and is very nice. Parking can be a bit of a mess as one parking lot is a bit of a hike and the other one for our tower had limited parking but we always seemed to get lucky and find a spot. They allow non-hotel residents to park there during the day so it makes it a bit of a mess. Overall we very much enjoyed the stay, the other guests were overall nice, and the limited interactions we had with staff were all very nice and accommodating.
2. Food.

* Marks Place-10/10- Awesome plate-style lunch, my wife got Chicken Katsu, I got Chicken Cutlets and we both loved it, it was lunch and dinner for us, the serving was HUGE, its pretty close to Ligue airport, we loved this place.
* Tiki Tacos-10/10- We ate here twice, and loved it, Pollo Cabron was my favorite, and Kailua Pork was also good, but all of them were excellent and the people were very nice.
* Sams- 6/10- Food was good, service was not good, and the other patrons were terrible. The view was nice but this was not our crowd, it was a much older crowd getting piss drunk. Once our server learned we were not buying alcohol he ghosted us, the bus boy was the only one we saw and we had to ask him twice if he would help us find our server, we gave him a tip personally because he was the only one actually paying us attention. The parking lot is also terrible, with very limited spots and very tight plus factor in people are drinking.
* Monster Sushi/Thai-9/10- We got Chicken Katsu and Panang Curry and enjoyed both, we would've gone here twice but it was closed on Monday I believe.
* Hanalei Poke-9/10- Very Good if you're on the north end of Kauai, very much enjoyed it and they have brown rice which was more difficult than I was hoping on Kauai.
* Kountry Kitchen- 8/10- We ate here for breakfast, actually at The Cafe next door because the wait was so long, I got the Spam sandwich and it was really good, great breakfast spot.
* Jammin Banana- 8/10- Great breakfast spot in Lihue
* Java Kai-9.5/10 Probably our favorite coffee spot on Kauai, I got a Maui Mocha and it was so good, it was pretty busy even in the afternoon, plus they have banana bread and other sweet treats.

3. Adventures

* Kauai Backcountry Adventures-9.5/10- I loved this more than I thought I would. First, you ride on an open-air bus for about 45 minutes to an hour to tour the land to get to the spot to get on the intertubes, you get to visit their farm/ranch and see some nice photo spots and ask questions about Kauai and get some nice dry humor that we enjoyed. The inter-tubing itself is pretty fun, sometimes it felt like I was on a neverending tea cup ride at Disneyland and it made me a bit dizzy and is nearly impossible to stop, you will need to use your hands and feet to bounce off walls to guide yourself and it can be slightly taxing on your back to sit in the tube for an hour, I know, I'm old.  I highly recommend this, it's unique and I love it. We got lunch at the end, it was a nice little sandwich with chips and it hit the spot.
* Captain Andys- Lunch BBQ Snorkel- 9/10- These kinds of trips are always a toss in the air because nature determines much of it. We apparently got lucky because did not hit huge waves, at least compared to others. Water did get a bit choppy near the coast but nothing huge,  the sun was very penetrating through cloud cover so my pictures that day weren't great, but obviously the tour can't control that. The boat we were on was the 65' star class, it was decently sized but we wish there were fewer people, maybe at least 5 fewer, as expected, many people with ""main character vibes"" on this tour that believed they were the only people there and just said fuck everyone else, that they thought it was their personal photoshoot and I hate this because it makes me feel like I have to be aggressive to get good photos and I'm trying to be relaxed and be respectful with others. This is again not the tour's fault, so I'm not knocking them it just comes with the territory, more of a knock on society and some parts of people that are way too selfish. We only got to snorkel a short time, the water was quite choppy and the water was very murky and I couldn't see anything, my wife some a few fish but that's it, I never saw anything looking down but I could really only see a couple feet in front of me. Uncontrollable forces of nature. The crew was awesome and handled everything well, make sure you tip them! 
* Poipu Beach-9.5/10 Must Visit- Turtles come up on the beach towards the evening, it depends on the evening and weather, but it can vary when they come up. I've heard its as early as 330 or 4, and sometimes not until past 5. When we went there were so many people swimming that the people there serving as ""protectors"" and setting the boundaries to protect the turtles told us that the crowd and people swimming were scaring them away. Even after turtles showed up people kept swimming in the channel they were using trying to get close to them. Use common sense here people. It is nature, give them them their space, we are lucky to be able to watch so give them space, get your pictures, and let others get in to see too. Poipu Beach for a sunset was very pretty and I highly recommend it. Bring a plate lunch or some dinner with you, sit on a bench or the beach and eat as the sun goes down, I do not think you will regret it.
* Anini Beach-9/10 My favorite place to swim, way less popular and its a long stretch of beach on the north side, it allows people to spread out and the waters were nice and calm, you can do some snorkeling here too. My wife and I spent nearly an entire day here just farting around swimming and having fun.
* Hanalei Bay- 8.5/10-Nice place to visit for pictures and some great food options.
* Secret Beach Trailhead- We tried to do this, and saw the potential of this, but we didn't realize the hike involved and only saw the distance and not the elevation change, my wife wore sandals and I have a bum ankle so sadly we had to pass on attempting this. 
* Waimea Canyon-9/10 Must Visit- Not a long drive, but you will get some incredible views from multiple angles.
* Kauai Community Market- 9/10- This is on Saturday Morning and I believe it starts at 930AM until 1PM, I would highly recommend this, get yourself some fruits, of various kinds, some you maybe have never tried before. I was really hoping to try a sugarloaf pineapple but I could not find them while I was there sadly.  I heard its expensive ($30/pineapple) but I was willing to pay for the experience. I got some dragonfruit, starfruit,papaya, jackfruit, pineapple, guava, and passion fruit. 

Side Notes

* Places have odd hours, keep note of those if there is a restaurant you want to visit, this isn't the mainland haha, some places close on Saturdays, some on Sundays, some are closed on random weekdays, just pay close attention.
* Everything is close, if you don't like the weather in one area, go to another, or wait an hour. Don't let rain upset you. It happens, it's an island. I love the rain so it never upsets me. I live in LA where it rarely rains so I'll take it when I can get it. 
* Coffee is awesome on the island, get it.
* If you're renting a car, sign up for their version of a ""valued customer"", like on Budget you can get Fastbreak which lets you skip the line, people complained about waiting for 2 hours, I waited at the baggage pickup and my wife went and got the car and she beat me, she got our car and had to wait for me to get the luggage for like 5 minutes, this was surprising to us based on comments from others.
* If you love Toyota Tacomas, you will be in paradise. Lowered, stilted, lifted, you got all the sorts.
* Costco has some swimming shorts, some chocolates and some sushi that is made in the store if you want to bring some back to your room. Also, if you want a Hawaii-grown Pineapple to bring home, they are only $3.69. Pineapples aren't really grown on Kauai so you're just getting ones from Maui, but they are delicious and still support the economy there as far as I know. Don't pay the $10-20 dollars from The Pineapple store or other tourist traps, they are the same thing. You can take them through the airport all the same. I just did it with no issue.

Feel Free to ask me questions if you want, I am no expert obviously but we did go all over the place and tried a lot of different things.

We loved Kauai so much, it was our second time in Hawaii and first time in Kauai. We loved the people we met, we loved the areas, we loved how much more laid back it was. We were so sad to come home.

1692037948.0,Visiting Hawaii,"From a non-native/non-local (myself), can someone (local/native/other) help me understand the debate of local/natives not wanting tourists to come to any of the islands vs those who say it is ok? I am hoping this conversation can be as respectful as possible but I know it is hard during such an  unimaginable time.

There is an abundance of information being spread on all social media platforms, etc. and quite frankly it is overwhelming for those who may be planning trips but are being told multiple conflicting things by so many. 

It is not as easy as a decision for some as many people are making it out to be for multiple factors, say what you will. I really just am just hoping to gain an understanding from both sides and not create further conflict and hopefully this can help some feeling so uncertain to make the right decisions.",VisitingHawaii
1675915849.0,Waikiki hotels: I may have done too much research,"My husband and I are planning to book a 10 day stay on O‚Äôahu starting the 2nd week of May. We want to stay somewhere centrally located and figured Waikiki would be ideal. We also want to be on the beach or a very short distance from it. We thought Moana Surfrider was the one - beachfront, plenty of amenities, reasonably priced for what‚Äôs advertised. But after reading (probably too many) reviews, it seems like the rooms are getting dated and the rooms people think they‚Äôre paying for end up not being available. But researching a 5 star property like the Royal Hawaiian yielded similar results at a higher price point. Halekulani seems to deliver on the quality of the rooms, but it‚Äôs not on the beach. 

We‚Äôre just worried we‚Äôre going to get there and be given a room that‚Äôs less than what we were expecting. I know that we won‚Äôt be spending a huge amount of time in the room, but this is our first real vacation since 2019, so we really want to get the most out of our trip.

Any advice for a reliable hotel experience in Waikiki?",VisitingHawaii
1653799640.0,[Oahu] Trip Report,"A little overdue, but wanted to post my experiences from recommendations I got in the sub!

I visited Oahu May 9‚Äì13! We stayed at the Surfjack hotel that was cute, trendy and clean, but tbh, we chose the hotel based on the fact that they had a hotel Frenchie named Jack (my bf & I have a Frenchie and are a little obsessed ü§≠) that we never got to meet. The bartender was also visibly drunk and continued to drink the day we got there and ordered lunch to eat by the pool. The hotel is also loud (just with the street noise and people walking back to the hotels after being out at night), so don‚Äôt book it if you‚Äôre a light sleeper. 

We rented a car through Turo at the airport (the owner picked us up and handled the handoff away from airport property). I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning how polite and safe everyone drives in Oahu compared to California. 

We booked Ziplining through CLIMBWorks and had such a great experience, would highly recommend!

Hiked Manoa Falls ‚Äî very easy hike IMO, but muddy, so bring shoes you don‚Äôt mind getting messy.

Breakfast at Egghead Cafe & Eggs N‚Äô Things, both great and also highly recommend. We had a reservation at Egghead, but used to walk-up list to Eggs N‚Äô Things and waited less than 10 mins for our table.

Explored the murals in Kakaako, which was really cool. I‚Äôm from SF, so it reminded me of the city a little bit.

Had lunch at Tight Tacos, legit Mexican food üëåüèº

Got shaved iced from Matsumoto. Line was long, but moved fast.

Witnessed some sea turtles at Laniakea beach and snorkeled at Hanauma Bay. Reservations were easy to get IMO if you‚Äôre on the site right when tickets go up. Our reservation time was at 9 AM, I‚Äôm not an avid snorkeler (in fact this was only my second time ever) and I saw so many fish! Great experience!

Donuts at Leonard‚Äôs Bakery were *chefs kiss* as well!

Thank you so much to this community that helped make my trip so wonderful. We didn‚Äôt get to do everything we had hoped (4 days just isn‚Äôt enough), so will definitely be back!

1698605578.0,Best way to book flights on separate airlines to HNL,"Hello ‚ù§Ô∏è 
So my best friend just got engaged, and her fiance loved Hawaii so much that he wants to have a destination wedding there. I‚Äôve got no problem with this (besides funds that‚Äôll need to be scrounged up) as I see it as a great excuse to be back with my family, and especially giving them time to spend with my baby who will be 2 by the time we go for the wedding. 

We‚Äôve visited twice this past year already; I had finally planned to come back and visit for the first time in seven years, but then received devastating news not even a few days after booking my trip that caused another visit earlier than planned. 

Anyways.. 

I booked my last visits as two separate round trip tickets. One with American Airlines from East Coast to West Coast, the second with Hawaiian Airlines from West coast into Honolulu. I‚Äôd really love to keep flying Hawaiian, but there‚Äôs no flights from where I live obv. 

Does anyone know if there‚Äôs a way for me to book a flight from the East Coast to West Coast that would give me a connecting flight with HA to get to Honolulu? I know I can book a whole trip with AA, and even Delta, but I really just want to keep one leg with Hawaiian ):",VisitingHawaii

1674515199.0,Big Island Trip Report (1/14-1/24),"Aloha everybody. I just returned from one week on the Big Island of Hawai'i and wanted to share my experience to hopefully help others planning their trip.

Some foreword info:

* We've been to Hawai'i one time before. We visited Kauai last January for our honeymoon and had an incredible time.
* I'm pretty loyal to the Shaka Guide tours and use them whenever I can on the islands. This time they had five tours available for the big island and we did four of them. Some are more interesting than others, but that's just because some parts of the island tend to be more interesting than others.
* Our trip was heavily impacted by a flare of my husband's chronic illness. We definitely did not have as good of a time on this trip as we could have and we're pretty bummed about it, but that's life.
* This trip was a ""for no reason"" trip for us, so we did not want to splurge on lots of expensive tours. I was so enamored with Hawai'i after our honeymoon last year that I booked this trip on a whim. Probably shouldn't have done that, but when the time came I was happy to be doing it.
* I am three months pregnant which mildly affected our plans and what we were able to do.

Saturday 1/14 (Arrival Day):

We flew into Kona from an overnight layover in Seattle and arrived at around 12:30. Once we got off the plane, I just had a feeling that my husband and I should split up and I should go directly to the car rental place (Dollar). Thank every god that I did this. I haven't seen much about this, but the car rental situation on Big Island is an absolute disaster. When I arrived, there were only three people in line ahead of me, and the workers were averaging 10 minutes a customer. When I left an hour later, there were over 30 people in line and the line was wrapped around the building. Once you're done inside, you then have to wait for your car to actually be ready. This was about 45 minutes for me. We found out later that evening from overhearing people at dinner, that shortly after I got my car they were running out of vehicles. People had to take whatever was available (minivans/SUVs) instead of the compacts they reserved. Around 2 pm, the car rental agency told everyone to take an uber to their resort (>$100 for most rides and very limited availability) and to come back tomorrow morning to wait for a car. Apparently this is an every day occurrence. I would be extremely cautious when booking your flight to Big Island and to make sure you get in early enough to secure a rental car. 

Once we secured our rental car, we drove to our resort - The Wyndham Kona Hawaiian. It was nice enough and we got lucky with a room that had a bit of an ocean view. We got dinner at Broke Da Mouth Grindz which was delicious. We ordered the Kalua pork and beef bulgogi with rice and mac salad. Portions were large enough to feed us for two meals and the place was not as busy as I had read it could be. We probably waited about 20 minutes for the food. We hit the KTA for groceries and as always its about twice the price of what you would pay on the mainland. We were on east coast time, so went to bed around 7 pm. 

Sunday 1/15 (Kona/South Coast)

We headed out pretty early (7 am) for the Shaka Guide South Island Epic Coastal Journey. Main highlights were Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park , Punalu'u bake shop, Punalu'u black sand beach, and the South Point. We did not go to Volcanoes NP this day although the tour included it. Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park was beautiful and an excellent preservation of native Hawaiian architecture. Sometimes there can be turtles here, but we didn't see any today. We did see a massive herd (50+) of the goats that are all over the island. We had lunch at Punalu'u bake shop. We had two sandwiches that were good for the price and bought three of their malasadas. I hadn't heard of the malasadas from here, but they were pretty good. The black sand beach was very interesting and we did see turtles sunbathing here! South point was worth the ride down. It was very sunny and windy so be mindful of your outfit choices. We grabbed a shaved ice from a mobile stand that was set up and it was enjoyable. Lots of locals fishing down here but we didn't see anybody do the big cliff jump into the ocean that I was absolutely not interested in.

One thing we noticed today: the tour buses. We must have been on a popular route for them because there were at least 3 or 4 every place we stopped and soon enough everything was swarmed. The lines as Punalu'u bake shop went from 2-3 people to 40 deep very quickly. Just be mindful if you pull up somewhere and see these vans its probably going to be a wait for whatever you're there for, 

We got back to the hotel around 2 and decided to take a walk down Ali'i drive. I'm not sure if they do this every day or just some, but they had a section of Ali'i drive closed and set up with dozens of local vendors. We found a parking spot that was $15 an hour and walked around there for a bit. We decided to take our chances and move the car in hopes of finding somewhere cheaper to park for dinner. We were successful and ended up at Huggo's on the Rocks at 4:45 and were told it would be about 30 minutes for a table for 2. Of note, most all of the restaurants along this strip do not take reservations. It was closer to 20 and we were seated. I had a virgin mojito which mostly just tasted like sour mix. My expectations were low so it was fine. I got the fried shrimp and chips and my husband got fish tacos. A bit of a goof when they initially brought out fish and chips for me, but they quickly rectified it and even brought a complimentary dessert. We both really enjoyed our meals. That night they had live music and even hula dancing. We watched the sunset from our table and headed home since we had an early wake up the next day.

Monday 1/16 (Hawai'i Volcanoes NP)

If you didn't know, one of the volcanoes (Kilauea) within the NP is currently erupting and we really wanted to see the lava glow in the dark. However, I was pretty on top of things and knew that it was majorly crowded at night to see it. We took advantage of being on east coast time and woke up at 3 am to try to get there before sunrise at 7 am. We got out on time and managed to get there shortly before 6. It was still pretty busy at that time but very manageable. We first stopped at the Kilauea Iki overlook and got some great pictures and took some time to view the lava glow. Then, because we had the time, we drove to the devastation trail parking lot and did the short hike to view the lava from only half a mile away. They say this hike is 1 mile each way but that's simply not true. It was half a mile each way maximum. We got their after the sun had begun to rise, but still got a really nice view. 

After sunrise, we quickly refreshed at the visitor center than got started with the main hike we had planned for the day - The Kilauea Iki Trail and Crater Rim Trail. This hike was 3.2 miles round trip and about 800 feet of elevation gain. It was not challenging at all until your ascent out of the crater. Walking down through the crater was such a unique ecosystem and definitely unlike anything I've seen before. We were happy to have done it. In total, it took us less than two hours, and that includes a stop at the Thurston lava tubes. We ate a packed lunch of sandwiches around 9:30 am because we had gotten up so early and were famished! I will say that there are really no options for food in this national park. The Volcano House hotel has a restaurant but from my understanding it is a sit down restaurant which does not interest me in a NP.  We headed down Chain of Craters Road using the Shaka Guide tour. They will tell you to pull off a lot of places, but I didn't think they were all necessary. At a certain point, when you've seen 5 craters, they all start to look the same. Driving through the lava fields was interesting and we eventually made it down to the sea arch, which was a nice photo op. We started the long drive back to Kona around noon. We spent the evening relaxing at the hotel pool and ate our leftovers from Broke da Mouth. Another early bed time for us.

Tuesday 1/17 (Hilton Waikoloa Village Resort Pass)

My husband and I had been commenting non stop about how lucky we had gotten with the rental car, our room location, and Kilauea erupting so much...well today all of our luck ran out. 

I had booked a cabana at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on resort pass. I pretty much do this every trip I go on, just to ensure I have one really nice pool day. We arrived shortly before ten and got checked in to our cabana. The staff here were all so nice, and basically let us have the pick of whatever cabana we wanted. We briefly swam in the pool and then did some snorkeling in the lagoon area they have. We saw some really beautiful fish but no turtles, although apparently we were not in the right spot for them. Overnight, my husband had started to feel unwell but felt better in the morning. We figured he maybe had a hangover. Around noon, it became clear that it wasn't a hangover and instead was a flare of my husband's chronic illness. We went back to our hotel. I enjoyed the day pass but would not ever stay at this resort. The architecture was kind of weird and gaudy. I found the beverage prices to be astronomical, even for a resort ($6 for a can of soda). I ordered food here from one of the restaurants and it was downright horrible. We spent the majority of the day just letting him rest and hoping that he would feel better the next day. 

Wednesday 1/18 (An attempt at Hilo)

I had planned to do the Shaka Guide North Island Loop tour today because I wanted to visit the big farmer's market in Hilo. My husband was feeling better in the morning and thought he would be okay so off we went. We made it across saddle road and into Hilo when it became apparent that we were not going to be able to continue the day. I stopped briefly at the KTA in Hilo to pick up a few things and immediately turned back around and drove the hour and a half back to Kona. I picked up some Thai food from Original Thai Cuisine in Kona and thought it was just OK and very expensive as most things are in Hawai'i. 

I went to the pool at the resort for a bit and then we decided to try to go out for a drink and dessert. We landed at Don's Mai Tai. My husband got a Mai Tai flight and I got a virgin pina colada. We also ordered some shrimp for an appetizer. My husband had about two sips of his drink before feeling bad again so we asked for the check and headed back to the hotel. I feel for the bartender who probably wondered what was wrong with the Mai Tai flight he made that we only took one sip and left. 

Thursday 1/19 (Hapuna Beach and Kohala Coast)

Husband was again feeling moderately better this morning, so we decided to play it kind of close to home in case he took a turn and we had to leave. We went to Hapuna Beach, which I specifically picked because they had facilities (bathrooms, showers). When we arrived, we quickly learned that there was no water to the entire beach meaning no bathrooms or places to wash off sand. This beach would have been perfect if it had running water. The beach itself was beautiful and the water was crystal clear. There were quite large waves so we quickly realized we would not be snorkeling. Lots of people were boogie boarding and appeared to be having fun. We stayed about two hours. After that, we were considering doing the Shaka Guide Kohala Coast tour because it started pretty much where we were, but my husband was feeling iffy. 

We went to the Queen's Marketplace at Waikoloa Village so that I could do some shopping and he could wait it out and see if he wanted to go home or do the tour. The market place is an outdoor shopping center that has some name brand stores (crocs, Pacsun, etc.) but also a lot of Hawaiian specialty stores and art galleries. I did some souvenir shopping while my husband recouped. Eventually we decided to do the Kohala Coast tour. 

Highlights of this tour were the Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site, the statue of King Kamehameha, Polulu Valley Lookout, and driving through Waimea. The tour was nice, but nothing was really a standout. There was a hike we could have done into the Polulu valley, but we weren't feeling up to it. We really enjoyed driving through the rolling hills of Waimea and hearing the stories on the Shaka guide tour, as always.

For dinner, we went to Jackie Rey's Ohana Grill. We did make a reservation here and still waited a bit when we got there. I had the New York Strip and my husband had the Mahi Mahi. I thought my food was just okay, but my husband really liked his. It was his first meal in about three days. Service from Jeremy was wonderful and I really enjoyed my lilikoi faux-jito. Overall it was a fine place, but I thought the prices were steep for a restaurant that really had no ambiance to speak of. 

I should also mention, we originally had tickets booked to fly to Honolulu just for the day and visit the USS Arizona, do the diamond head hike, and visit/shop near Waikiki. We decided the night before that this was absolutely not happening and cut our losses. 

Friday 1/20 (Hilo...finally!)

Husband is finally feeling mostly recovered so we finally head into Hilo. We saw a really nice beach, Rainbow Falls, the Hawai'i Tropical Botanical Garden, Akaka Falls, Boiling Pots, Waipio Valley Lookout, and ate Tex's Malasadas. We had lunch at Tacos Jaliscos in Hilo which were the best street tacos I've ever had and very reasonably priced. All things considered, I enjoyed Rainbow Falls more than Akaka Falls. Akaka Falls doesn't seem worth the $25+ you pay just to park and it was inundated with people, to the point that it isn't even enjoyable. If you do take the whole loop around Akaka Falls, just know that it's a lot of stairs, at least way more than I expected. I was so happy that we made it to Tex's to try their Malasadas. They were different than the ones at Punalu'u bake shop, but good in their own way. I much prefer the dough and sugar on the outside of Tex's, but I felt like the fillings at Punalu'u were better. The Tropical Botanical Garden was the highlight of the day. We both really enjoy plants and found this spot to be interesting and so, so beautiful. I wasn't sure it would be worth the $50 price tag, but I'm very glad we did it. Waipio Valley was heavily covered with VOG. I didn't feel that Waipio Valley nor Polulu Valley compared at all the the beauty of the Napali coast on Kauai.

Back in Kona, I had a burger from Island Ono Loa Grill that was really good. The fries were actually the best part. We watched one final sunset and went to bed.

Saturday 1/21 (Departure Day)

Our last day. We packed up in the morning and went to 808 Grindz Cafe for breakfast. I had crab cake eggs benedict and my husband had corned beef eggs benedict. It seems we arrived just before the hoards. They were able to take our order right away and food came out quickly. When we were leaving lines were 10 people deep. 

We returned the rental and got to the airport for our 3 pm trip back to Seattle for another overnight layover before heading to actual home on Sunday. 

We were both feeling pretty emotional and bummed at the trip ending. Even though we were able to do things on Thursday and Friday,  my husband still wasn't feeling well and wasn't able to enjoy himself. Coupled with how much fun we had the first two days, we were feeling very disappointed at how the rest had gone. Of course, it's the risk you take and not everything can be sunshine and rainbows every time. I can confidently say we made the best of it and that I enjoyed all the time I got to spend with my love.

It's tough to fully give an accurate assessment of the big island due to the circumstances. That being said, I definitely enjoyed Kauai more and think it would still be the same if we had been able to do everything we wanted on the big island. While I knew the drive times between places ahead of time, I underestimated the impact that would have on me (who generally likes driving). The driving places and then promptly turning around due to illness didn't help either. The big island is definitely remarkable for all of it's lava, but I enjoyed the lush tropical scenery of Kauai more. The only thing I didn't get to do on the big island that I wanted to was stargaze at Mauna Kea. We had a few opportunities to go up during the day, but didn't feel it would be worth it. You also cannot go to the summit if you are pregnant, so I wasn't sure that it would be worth it to go just to the visitor center (especially with the VOG situation).

I hope this trip report was helpful to someone and I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have.",VisitingHawaii
1674393039.0,PSA: Do not go to the north shore today unless you want to be stuck in traffic for hours.,"A huge surfing tournament is taking place today at Waimea Bay, The Eddie. It is the first time this event is being held since before COVID, and crowds started camping out for it yesterday. [Cars have started lining up for miles along the highway as of 2am this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/10ifu67/people_parked_along_the_highway_already_1_mile/), and traffic is expected to be backed up past Haleiwa and Kahuku. 

If you were planning on trying to see the north shore today, move your plans to a different day. It won't be worth sitting in literal hours of traffic.

If you're trying to watch the tournament and you're not there already, my advice would be to get to Haleiwa (you will probably still hit traffic) and bike in from there.

1689038275.0,A Full Summary of Restaurant and Food Experiences from My Trip to Kauai,"My husband and I went to Kauai in February. I kept a running list of where we ate. I finally had time to expand my thoughts and fully compile this list. I saw a post similar to this before my trip to Kauai, and I found it really helpful, so I hope you all find this helpful, too! A little about us: we are a childfree couple and live in Oregon. This was our second trip to Kauai. We are very much foodies and enjoy food experiences ranging from small holes in the wall to the best restaurants in Portland.  

(Note, when I comment that something is expensive, I am keeping in mind prices in Kauai. I know everything is more expensive there, and I know eating out is just more expensive everywhere right now. If I say something is expensive I mean it is expensive *even* for Kauai *in my opinion*.)

So, here is a list of everywhere we ate in Kauai and what we thought:

Puka Dog (Poipu): This was the first place my husband and I went after we landed. Delicious, but not quite as good as I remember it from seven years ago. I remember the inside of the bun being more crispy before. That is being nit-picky, though. It is super tasty and a concept that is unique to Kauai. I think it's pretty much a must. Also, their fresh lemonade is delicious. The newer location is great because you can easily go eat at Poipu Beach.

Lilikoi (Lihue): This is a place we went to purely out of convenience because we were staying at the Royal Sonesta and it was close by. The food was good, not great. Also, it's my opinion that every item on the menu was $5-10 more than it should have been for what you got (again, I am keeping in mind Kauai prices and inflation in general). I got a kalua pork sandwich, and it came on homemade bread which I thought was a nice touch.

Kukui's (Lihue): This is the restaurant at the Royal Sonesta. It's also overpriced and just okay. We probably wouldn't have eaten there if we didn't have a $200 dining credit there from Costco (who we booked our trip through). Drinks are tasty, but expensive and weak (which I know is normal for resorts.) The best thing I had there was the acai bowl for breakfast even though it‚Äôs not a fresh acai bowl- it‚Äôs clearly a pre-made scoopable product. But, the serving size was good and the fresh fruit on it was delicious. If you have a dining credit there, I recommend using it on breakfast. We tried lunch there and it was just okay. Lovely service!

Nawiliwili Tavern (Lihue): Also close to the Sonesta, but a haven from the touristy places that surround it. It's a dive bar, and I love it so much. If you like dive bars, you would like it too. Great place to hang out, chat with locals and other down-to-earth tourists, get less expensive drinks, play pool (it's free), and/or sing karaoke. I hope this place stays there forever!

Kenji Burger (Koloa Old Town): We ate at the Koloa location. Fun atmosphere with patio-style dining, decent prices. The food concepts are good, but we found our meals to be under-seasoned. Overall, I think it's a decent choice for the prices. In retrospect, I would probably opt to try one of the food carts in the area instead. 

Mango's (Koloa Old Town): This is a little ice cream shop that's in one of the newer buildings in Koloa's old town. They have multiple flavors of Dole Whip, which is what we got. I got the mango flavor and very much enjoyed it. Get the kid's size- they are generous with their portions.

Kauai BBQ and Boba (Lihue): This is one of the food carts near the Sonesta. Fairly good Hawaiian food at a fair price. Rice was a little mushy and the beef was a bit jerky-like in texture. But, the mac salad and the BBQ chicken was delicious.

Aloha Liege Waffles (Lihue): This is the other food cart near the Sonesta that I ate at. Absolutely delicious! Highly recommend. Get one with fresh fruit; fresh fruit is always a good choice in Hawaii. I like that they chop the waffle into pieces so it's easier to eat. I would have eaten there multiple times if I had the chance.

Kauai Beer Company (Lihue):: Menu doesn't have a ton of options, but the food is quite good. Husband said their reuben was one of the best he'd ever had. Beers are tasty. They also have cool t-shirts.

Bar Acuda (Hanalei): The best meal we had on the island. Worth it if you want to splurge on a fancier meal- it is expensive but we felt the value matched the quality. Make sure you get your reservations in a month in advance; we saw many people being turned away. The concept is Spanish tapas, but I would say it's more just modern American. Highly recommend.

Kauai Bakery and Coffee (Lihue): You have to experience malasadas in Hawaii, and this is a good place to do it!

Tropical Dreams Ice Cream (Kapa‚Äôa): Had some fun flavors, but the scoops were TINY and expensive. Recommend going to Wailua Shave Ice, which is located in the same shopping center. (T only reason we didn't go there is because they closed the second we walked in. But, I we have visited their Portland location several times. They are amazing!)

Sunrise Coffee (Lihue): a little cart, so great. I am not a big coffee drinker, but this was the smoothest, least bitter coffee I have ever had in my life. We also got the avocado toast, which was delicious and big enough for my husband and I to share. 

Chicken in a Barrel (Waimea): Pretty decent BBQ. If you‚Äôre used to amazing BBQ, this isn‚Äôt it. The sides were a little bland- the mac salad was watery. But, the property is beautiful and it‚Äôs really nice to sit outside. There weren‚Äôt any signs saying you couldn‚Äôt, so my husband and I wandered around after we ate and enjoyed the beach views and the lovely unique trees on the property. AND they have this fun setup with beer where you get a token and you can pour it yourself. They had many choices, and it was fun to sample different kinds and just pay for what you drink. I think this is a nice choice for a stop on your way to or back from the Canyon. 

Waikomo Shave Ice (Koloa): This is a tiny shave ice cart in the parking lot by Da Crack. All their syrups are naturally flavored and I very much enjoyed my shave ice there. There was a long line, but I think it was worth it. 

Noka Grill (Lihue): My husband had a breakfast burrito there and he said it was just okay and very expensive. You could probably pass on this place.

Scorpacciata Pizza (Lihue): Really good! Was understaffed when we went, but we really enjoyed what we got and liked sitting on the little patio. In particular, I am remembering fries that came with a pesto aioli kind of dipping sauce that we really loved. 

Kountry Kitchen (Kapa‚Äôa): Be prepared to wait! Absolutely delicious, but we tried to go on a Saturday morning and it was packed. You can add your name to the list through their website, which we did and I recommend you do as well. Even then it took about an hour and a half for a table. Their french toast looked SO GOOD but it was sold out by the time we were seated. :( Loved the lavender latte. We will be back next time we come to Kauai. 

Duke‚Äôs Kitchen (Lihue): Ended up going here last-minute just because it was pouring down rain and we could walk from the Sonesta. Food was decent. It didn‚Äôt blow me away, but it was good-ish. Drinks were about the same price as the bar at Sonesta, but bigger and better. The little salad bar was surprisingly good! I don‚Äôt know if they have an option to just get that, but if they did, I would think about getting it for a lighter meal. I really enjoyed the selection of specialty pasta salads. Good service, and nice ambiance. There‚Äôs an indoor waterfall and they have live music most nights. 

Hapa Kaua‚Äôi (Koloa): They had very recently opened when we were there and I could tell they were still working out some kinks. It‚Äôs spendy, but the food is worth the cost in my opinion. What threw me off, and I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve changed this since we visited or not, was that it‚Äôs a semi-upscale restaurant, but you order at the counter. Therefore, the counter had quite a long line. There were plenty of waitstaff dropping off food and drinks, so I really just didn‚Äôt understand why they weren‚Äôt taking orders at tables. Again, maybe they were just trying to work out the kinks of the new restaurant. We decided to go there because the owners previously had a restaurant in Portland. I would say the food was on par with something you‚Äôd find in Portland.

Honorable mentions and a couple notes:

\-Get the specialty pie at McDonalds.

\-If you want to get Mauna Loa macadamia nuts of all varieties, the best prices are at Walmart. They have other fun, specialty snacks as well, and even affordable Hawaiian style clothing if you‚Äôre looking for it. 

\-7-11 has really good and special/unique snacks

\-Costco has some great specialty snack items. It was big and tough to fit in my suitcase, but I was really happy I got a big box of Kauai Kookies that I have been able to share with friends and family back home. 

We will definitely be back to Kauai, so if we missed your favorite spot, let me know and I will make sure to put it on our list. ",VisitingHawaii
1667449328.0,[Kauai][Maui] Trip Report! 10/21-30,"\*Sorry for the lengthy post!\*

&#x200B;

My partner \[32M\] and me \[28F\] got back from our trip on Sunday night and we had such a great time. It was so fun planning this trip and reading everyone‚Äôs posts in this sub, I decided to write a trip report.

&#x200B;

We originally planned to come to Hawaii in September 2021 but cancelled it 2 weeks before leaving due to the Delta spike. Unfortunately, due to vacation schedules this year, our rescheduled trip was 2 fewer days and we had to cut some things.

&#x200B;

We love trying different foods, hiking, learning new things, and State/National Parks. We mostly like being active, but also enjoy a day at the resort.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[Day 1 - Friday\]**

&#x200B;

MDW->OAK then OAK->LIH on Southwest (points). Arrived in Kauai at 11:30 AM. We picked up our rental car from Hertz. I rented a plain sedan but we were given a Challenger. LOL

&#x200B;

For ‚Äúlunch‚Äù, we both had Chicken Teriyaki from Mark‚Äôs Place.

&#x200B;

We picked up groceries at Safeway, then headed towards Lawaii, where the BnB we stayed in was.

&#x200B;

We made a stop at Warehouse 3540 where we got coffee from Kind Coffee Co. The coffee was great and this place has a lot of cute shops.

&#x200B;

Settled into the BNB, met the owner‚Äôs animals and got the scoop on all of the trees and plants on their property. The BNB was set back in a forest and was really close to most things we wanted to do!

&#x200B;

Sunset at Salt Pond Beach but it was cloudy. Still beautiful!

&#x200B;

After sunset, we headed to downtown Hanapepe for Art Night. There are tons of vendors on the street selling food, fruit, and other items. All of the shops and art galleries are also open and they have musicians on the street. I originally planned for us to grab dinner at Japanese Grandma but I ended up getting a waffle dog and my partner got a curry plate from a food stand. We bought banana bread for the morning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[Day 2 - Saturday\]**

&#x200B;

Woke up early!!! Then we were able to fall back asleep until 7:30.

&#x200B;

This day, we used the Waimea Canyon tour on Shaka Guide. It was really great for this specific tour but we made a few detours.

&#x200B;

We stopped in Hanapepe, then got coffee, avocado toast, a sandwich, and a mac nut cinnamon roll at Midnight Bear Bakery. The espresso machine was down (the horror!). The food was really tasty and we LOVED the pastry. We walked across the street to the Hanapepe Swinging Bridge.

&#x200B;

For a picnic lunch, we picked up some snacks from Ishihara Market.

&#x200B;

We hiked the Canyon Overlook Trail 1 mile each way. It was muddy and hilly. We spent a few days in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in June and they are quite similar, but the hike was definitely worth the view!

&#x200B;

We stopped at Koke‚Äôe Lodge. You can feed the chickens here so there are a ton! We got coffee (again) and enjoyed the live music (a violinist and a guitar/ukulele/banjo playing singer). This was an awesome rest stop!! I also bought some postcards at their little store.

&#x200B;

Heading up a little more and we got some stunning overlooks of the Na‚ÄôPali coast. I‚Äôm so glad we didn‚Äôt turn around!

&#x200B;

Back in Waimea, we got pina colada shave ice with mac nut ice cream from Jojo‚Äôs. We stopped at the Captain Cook monument and the Menehune Swinging Bridge, then headed back to the BNB.

&#x200B;

We watched sunset from Poipu Beach and I originally planned to eat at Keoki‚Äôs Paradise but we were exhausted. We grabbed takeout from Da Crack and ate it back at home. I had a bowl with blackened fish and chipotle sour cream. It was really good.

&#x200B;

**\[Day 3 - Sunday\]**

&#x200B;

This day, we did the Captain Andy‚Äôs snorkel tour that departed from Port Allen. It was great! The whole process was so easy. For breakfast, they gave us an oatmeal bar and some fruit while we headed up to the Na‚ÄôPali coast. We passed Hanakapai Beach to get the views, then we headed back down the coast to our snorkel spot. They had the sails up for a short period. There was coffee before getting on the boat and while we were on the boat.

&#x200B;

Snorkeling was nice. We saw a monk seal and a small turtle, then a few types of fish. We jumped off the boat a few times. Snorkeling lasted \~45 minutes. For lunch, we had pineapple, kimchi rice, and a turkey apple and ?? sandwich, with a white chocolate chip cookie for dessert. At this point, they ask you a lot of times if you want something to drink (beer or wine). The ride back was wild and bumpy. If you are prone to motion sickness, definitely take non-drowsy Dramamine.

&#x200B;

After the boat, we stopped at the Kauai Coffee Company. We sampled a few different roasts then got coffee from their little shop. You can pick whatever roast you want, which is nice. We bought beans to take home.

&#x200B;

Coffee did nothing to help the state of things so we took a nap back at the BNB. Said hello to the horses, then we went to dinner at Lava Lava Beach Club. Half of this restaurant is in sand, but they seated us at the table right on the edge of the actual floor. This was a great spot. We had coconut shrimp, a Hawaiian pizza, and fried rice. I had a mai tai and my partner had some different beers (sorry I did not document them). All of it was really good! They had live music and there were good vibes at this restaurant.

&#x200B;

We stopped at Liwae Market to pick up ice cream sandwiches for dessert. This is a great little market and they also have food!

&#x200B;

**\[Day 4 - Monday\]**

&#x200B;

Our last full day on Kauai!!

&#x200B;

We drove FAR from Lawai to grab the shuttle for Haena State Park. \~1.5 hours, not ideal but we were lucky with most things being close by. The rain started almost immediately and didn‚Äôt really stop for good all day.

&#x200B;

We got coffee from Java Kai. I got a mac nut latte and it CHANGED MY LIFE it was so good. I also got a bagel with cream cheese, pesto, and tomato which was soooo good.

&#x200B;

We got to the parking lot for the shuttle and I realize we are late (I thought our reservation was for 7:40 but it was actually 7:20). No worries, they put us on the next shuttle. You can go standby if you are late, but there are no guarantees. We got lucky but this was also bad planning on my part. The shuttle took around 30 minutes.

&#x200B;

We hiked about 1.5 miles of the Kalalau Trail. Someone had left a stick at the trailhead and it came in handy. The rain was on and off, but at times it was scary to continue, I was worried we would slip. At the first mile, there is a really great view. We didn‚Äôt make it to the beach (wouldn‚Äôt have enjoyed it anyway! but it would have been cool to make it to the falls). On the way back, we saw a double rainbow! This, coupled with the stunning Na‚ÄôPali coast, was so incredible to see.

&#x200B;

We headed back to Hanalei and got coffee at the Coffee House.

&#x200B;

For lunch, we ate at the Kiluea Fish Market. We got poke and a poke wrap. The wrap was like a poke burrito and it was soooo good!

&#x200B;

We saw the Kiluea Lighthouse, then headed back down to Poipu. We stopped at a fruit market and had guava, red dragon fruit, and bananas. All of the fruit was sooo good!

&#x200B;

We spent some time on Poipu Beach and saw some giant turtles.

&#x200B;

We also did a little bit of Shaka Guide for Koloa and Poipu. It was interesting to hear about the sugar plantations, but I‚Äôm not sure we would recommend this one. We walked around Koloa but didn‚Äôt spend too much time.

&#x200B;

For dinner, we went to Kauai Island Brewing. The Mai tai is made with lilikoi and is soooo tasty! My partner had Captain Cooks and Canefire Red. For dinner, we had kahlua pork nachos and coconut shrimp (my favorite). It was so tasty!!

&#x200B;

**\[Day 5 - Tuesday\]**

&#x200B;

Our interisland flight was at 11:55 so all morning I moped around instead of packing. I didn‚Äôt want to leave Kauai and our wonderful BNB!

&#x200B;

We stopped for coffee at Aloha Roastery in Lihue before returning the Challenger, which turned out to be a fun car!

&#x200B;

On Maui, we got a package for the car/hotel through Costco. We had the car for 5 days but only stayed at the hotel for 3 days. Costco was very accommodating with this!!

&#x200B;

We had an all white Jeep which made us feel cool hahaha. We had lunch at Paia Fish Market which HIT THE SPOT! Definitely put this place on your list.

&#x200B;

We went to Mana Market down the street to pick up food for the next few days as we were staying near Hana and didn‚Äôt want to have to coordinate finding lunch.

&#x200B;

We arrived at our accommodations around 5:45 which was just as the sun was going down. We played a few card games and relaxed after our travel day. Interisland travel is quick but definitely‚Ä¶it didn‚Äôt help that we drove 2 hours on the winding Road to Hana! This was ambitious and probably not recommended.

&#x200B;

We did Gypsy guide for RTH but it really didn‚Äôt help for our itinerary. My s/o was also tired of listening to it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[Day 6 - Wednesday\]**

&#x200B;

This was my birthday!! It was raining all day, but that is okay because I love the rain. There were too many clouds to see the sunrise, so we took a little walk to see the beach before getting ready for the day.

&#x200B;

For coffee and a snack, we stopped at Hana Farms. We got the mac nut banana bread, a pineapple and coffee. The bread was SO good, we bought more immediately. We also bought some black salt here.

&#x200B;

On the way to Haleakala, we stopped at a few ‚Äúsights‚Äù including a waterfall.

&#x200B;

We got our National Park passport stamped and went to the gift shop. Then, we hiked the Pipiwai Trail to Waimoka falls (4 miles total). This was our favorite hike even though at one point I felt like the rain was actually a waterfall. It was definitely worth it to get here early in the morning. On our hike back, the trail was getting busy and more muddy. The trail is moderately challenging, but they have a boardwalk for part of it, so the flat parts are nice. I saw a LOT of people in flip flops and white pants. I wouldn‚Äôt attempt this without sturdy shoes!

&#x200B;

We also did the Kuloa trail to see the Pools of Oheo. If you don‚Äôt want to hike up a giant hill, just turn back the way you came after seeing the Pools. Learn from my mistake!!

&#x200B;

We had sandwiches in the trunk of the Jeep, sheltering from the rain. It was funny. On the way back towards Hana, we bought two GIANT avocados and a pineapple from a fruit stand. The pineapple was delicious! My partner was somehow still hungry, so we stopped at the food truck park for coffee (My Tita‚Äôs Coffee, ended up buying grounds and Lava Taco Taqueria). This was an okay stop. I ate half of the giant avocado. Avocado is my favorite food, but this was a lot of avocado.

&#x200B;

We went to Wai‚Äôanapanapa State Park/the black sand beach for a little while. We played in the waves which were very large. It rained a little bit, but we had a fun time! I much prefer the tiny black rocks to fine sand.

&#x200B;

We drove to Hana Ranch restaurant which I was apprehensive about due to mixed reviews. I cannot fathom why anyone has negative things to say about this place, it was really wonderful.  I had a mai tai with likikoi foam. We split the teriyaki chicken and tofu curry stir fry. Both were incredible!!! For dessert we had a cheesecake with a guava glaze and berries. Soooo incredibly tasty. The restaurant is small and charming, and the staff was very friendly.

&#x200B;

We played a card game to end the night! This was really fun and helped us stay off our phones.

&#x200B;

**\[Day 7 - Thursday\]**

&#x200B;

It feels like we are heading on a whole new vacation when we head back to Ka‚Äôanapali. We took the top off the Jeep because it wasn‚Äôt raining. We stopped at Hana Harvest for coffee. The coconut bread was good but I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of my iced coffee. I should have gotten drip, my partner liked his!!

&#x200B;

It took a LONG time to get to Ka‚Äôanapali. It definitely helped to spend two nights near Hana! We made a few stops on the way back including food trucks in Kahului for an a√ßa√≠ bowl.

&#x200B;

We checked into the Ka‚Äôanapali Beach Hotel and our room was ready \~1 hour before check-in. We walked around the resort, wrote and mailed more post cards, and had a mai tai while we waited for our room to be ready.

&#x200B;

We changed before heading down to Lahaina to go to Star Noodle. The best reservation time I could get was 3:30, which was actually perfect. We ate way too much, but everything was delicious. We had pork buns, garlic noodles, miso eggplant, and some noodle with scallops that I didn‚Äôt write down the name of. The eggplant was my favorite part. This was too much food for two people. Learn from my mistake!

&#x200B;

We walked down Front St. and I bought a print from Lahaina Printsellers. We watched the sun set behind Lanai.

&#x200B;

Back at the hotel, we had a drink outside the restaurant, Huihui, where they had live music and hula dancers. It was really nice! It was also nice to interact with more people/tourists, as we had spent most of the trip ‚Äúon the move‚Äù. We watched the surfing channel before going to bed.

&#x200B;

**\[Day 8 - Friday\]**

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs time for our scheduled rest day!!

We walked past the golf course to Island Press Coffee. This was my second favorite coffee place, but we had to walk up a hill from the hotel. I was not expecting to do this on our rest day. I bought a mug and we watched a few golfers tee off on our walk back to the hotel.

We drove to Lahaina to get bagels from Westside Bagel and Bakery. We ate them on our lanai and watched people down below. The sandwiches were OK but I am not a bug breakfast sausage person so it could have been what I ordered. The bagel was good!

We rented snorkel gear and headed to Black Rock. We saw tons of fish! We jumped off the rock a few times, which felt very dangerous. ‚ÄúIf it wasn‚Äôt safe, they wouldn‚Äôt let you do it‚Äù is a lie I have told myself many times in the past week.

We returned our snorkel gear, then hung out by the pool for a little while. We were tired of being in the sun, so we hung out in the room and relaxed most of the day!

We sat outside for ‚Äúhappy hour‚Äù which involved my partner getting one drink while I sat on a lounge chair.

We chose Feast at Lele for our luau experience. We got there \~20 minutes before check-in. The line was about 10 people deep already! They gave us leis and took our drink order. We took lots of pictures with the sunset background. All of the food was really great!!! The menu is online, but it is plated per table instead of a buffet. I really enjoyed the music that they had going and the show was awesome!! They explained a lot about the different Polynesian islands.

We watched the surfing channel again.

**\[Day 9 - Saturday\]**

&#x200B;

Our last day! Obviously we are tired, so we took our sweet time getting ready to go.

We got breakfast at Kihei Caffe which was awesome! I had their coffee special, an Ube Coconut Latte, which was PURPLE. The loco moco was a lot of food, but it was tasty! We also had 1 piece of french toast with mac nut on top. We sat outside. This place was really nice all said.

Finally, we made our way to upcountry. We weren‚Äôt in the mood to make any stops, so we headed up to Haleakala (part 2). There are two passport stamps: one at the HQ visitor center and one at the summit. We did the short hike near the visitor center, but a cloud came over so we saw nothing.

We then hiked a few miles of Sliding Sands. The way back was an uphill challenge!! The views were spectacular and it was a nice hike because the sun was out.

We had light jackets with us but we were underprepared - it is cold! Wear something warm for sunset.

We watched sunset and waited for the stars to come out (about an hour after). We could see so many stars!

We headed back to Ka‚Äôanapali and got takeout from Monkeypod (pizza and salad). We watched the surfing channel one last time. I still don‚Äôt understand how it works, but it was still cool to watch.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

What Worked:

* Staying close to places we wanted to see most
* Having a general idea/repository of restaurants to pick from. A few times, we deviated from the original plan because we really weren‚Äôt feeling like sitting down at a restaurant/wanted to relax more. It helped to have a few ideas in the area so we could make a plan quickly.
* Staying in a resort only at the end of our trip. We didn‚Äôt feel guilty spending the whole day exploring when we stayed at low-key accommodations. They were just what we needed.

Lessons Learned:

* I could have used a coffee pot
* Hiking poles would have been great
* Always bring a rain jacket on hikes
* Depending on where you are staying, things don‚Äôt get dry‚Ä¶I should have brought more plastic bags to separate the damp things!
* I would have taken our interisland flight earlier instead of mid-day
* Download more than two hours of songs before venturing into more remote areas. We listened to ‚ÄúHooked on a Feeling‚Äù so many times it‚Äôs not even funny.

Things we Missed:

* Kayaking to Wailua Falls
* Koloa Rum tasting room
* Iao Valley (it was closed, but we also didn‚Äôt really have time)
* Cultural classes at KBH (lei making, hula)
* Maui Wines

&#x200B;

It was a great trip!!! I probably would not change very much. It really took a lot of research figuring out how to structure our trip. For the average traveler looking to actually relax on a vacation, this itinerary would be a lot. It worked for us! Of course, we are already working on plans to come back. So much to see, so little time.

Thank you for reading!!",VisitingHawaii
1659484601.0,Oahu Trip Report - 11 days,"Hello all! I've used this sub a lot to make plans for my trips, so I wanted to share an overview of my trip.

**Background Info**: Me, (34), my husband (35), my brother (33), and my mom (64) went to Oahu. My husband and I got there on Thursday 7/14 and left on Monday 7/25. He had business meetings on the island from Monday the 18th -through Friday the 22nd, so I had my brother and mom join me in the middle. They landed Monday 7/18 and left Sunday 7/24. It was mine and my husband‚Äôs third trip to the island and my mom‚Äôs and brother‚Äôs 1st trip.

I‚Äôm vegetarian, but the rest of my group isn‚Äôt, so I‚Äôm always looking for restaurants that satisfy everyone. Our strategy is to buy food for breakfast and lunch and the grocery store and then splurge on restaurants for dinner.

**Thursday** \- landed in Honolulu early afternoon. Lyft to **Prince Waikiki**, were able to check us in early, and we got settled into the room. I love this hotel. We have stayed here every time and would stay here again. Everyone is super kind and helpful. The view from the room is wonderful and the room is spacious. It‚Äôs at the end of Waikiki, so it feels removed from the real touristy-feeling areas in the rest of Waikiki. And as a childless couple not wanting to be surrounded by children, I also recommend the Prince. After we unpacked, we walked down Waikiki beach and got dinner in a shopping center. Went to bed early, still on west coast time.

**Friday** \- go to pick up **Turo** at 8am, but when we get there the owner said that the air conditioning had broken the night before. This is not going to work, so I spent about 2 hours on the phone with Turo before they found us a new car. The best they could do was drop the car off around 2pm, so we had to scratch our beach day at Kailua. Instead we walked down to **Waikiki beach** and swam around there for a while. It was rockier than expected, but we did see a few turtles. The Turo was delivered and then we went to the grocery store to pick up breakfast and lunch supplies.

* **Dinner at Tane Vegan Izakaya** \- love this restaurant so much! Returned to the hotel and walked down to the beach to watch the fireworks.

**Saturday** \- early morning walk down to **Ala Moana Beach Park**. Because of a hurricane that had come through, there were pretty big waves, so we walked to the end of Magic Island and watched the surfing for a while.

Drove up to **21 Degrees Estat**e for the chocolate tour and tasting. Really interesting and enjoyable, especially if you're interested in chocolate. Drove to nearby **He'eia State Park** to eat the lunch we‚Äôd packed. Drove back to the hotel, hung out by the pool a little.

* Dinner - got sandwiches at **EARL** (it was fine, but kinda spendy for what we got) and then went to the **Honolulu Museum of Art** (open late on Saturdays and free admission because we‚Äôre staying at the Prince). This is a nice place to visit at night when there‚Äôs less to do otherwise.

**Sunday** \- We had a reservation for **Diamond Head hike** from 8-10am, which we figured we should finally do. Arrived a little after 8. Definitely moderate by the end, but not too bad. The trail wasn‚Äôt too crowded, but the top was pretty packed. We enjoyed this hike a lot and felt like we had accomplished something and could chill the rest of the day. Back to the hotel and then to **Kailua Beach** for the rest of the day.

**Monday** \- Spent the morning reading by the pool. Was supposed to pick up my family at the airport around noon, but they were delayed until 3. Picked them up, got them checked into the Equus Hotel and cleaned up.

* **Dinner at Fete**. Requested a table upstairs in the cookbook room, which has many fewer tables and is much less loud. Takes a little longer for the servers to get the food up to your, but worth it for the calm. Everything was delicious!

**Tuesday** \- **Windward side drive**. First stop, **Leonard‚Äôs truck**. No line, great malasadas. Went down to **Chinawalls** to attempt some geocaching. Got to watch some more surfing, nice little stop. Stopped by the **Halona Blowhole** and **Sandy Beach**. Stopped at the Kailua Whole Foods for lunch. Went to the **Byodo-In Temple**. Then up to **Kualoa Ranch** for the Jungle Expedition Tour. I would recommend this tour for the ranch experience at a lower price than many of the other tours. Back to the hotel to clean up.

* **Dinner at Kapa Hale.** Everything was super tasty here as well, make sure not to skip dessert!

**Wednesday** \- **Kailua beach** in the morning. Back to the hotel to clean up and then to **Iolani Palace** for the Royal Connection to Japan Tour at 1pm. After a peek into some Hawaiian history, we were looking for more, so we went straight to the **Bishop Museum**. Both times I‚Äôve gone, I was able to get cheaper tickets through groupon and then use them for admission. We were there close to when they closed at 5. Back to the hotel to change.

* **Dinner at The Pig and the Lady**. Really tasty, but big portions so it‚Äôs easy to over-order.

**Thursday** \- Reservations for the **Lyon Arboretum** from 9-11am, made for free ahead of time - asked for $5/person donation upon arrival. I feel like this place is underrated. There are so many paths, you can really take your own adventure through the jungle and see all different kinds of plants. Just make sure you use lots of bug spray! Spent about 2 hours here. Dropped brother off at **Manoa Falls Trail** (he did not enjoy, muddy, crowded, and basically the same as the arboretum except for the okay waterfall at the end). Mom and I went to the hotel to change.

Mom wanted breakfast, even though it was like noon, so we went to the **Koko Head Caf√©**. Of all the places we went to eat, this was the only one that disappointed me and that I would not go back to. Picked up brother from the hike and then headed over to **Pearl Harbor**. Got there a little early for our 3pm reservation to the Arizona Memorial. Mom and brother went on the Bowfin Submarine tour when I met up with my husband and we watched the Arizona video (not running on our last visit) and then checked out some exhibits.

* **Dinner** \- my family members were tired of ‚Äúfancy‚Äù food so I canceled my Senia reservation (sad!) and we got **Marugame Udon** delivered to the hotel, hung out there playing cards for the rest of the night.

**Friday** \- **Chinatown Tour** at 9:30 am from the **Hawai‚Äôi Heritage Center**. If you go, make sure to call ahead and confirm you‚Äôll be there, even though they don‚Äôt take reservations. We had a wonderful time on the tour, and got to see a lot of Chinatown we wouldn‚Äôt have seen otherwise, learn some history, and sample some food. Tour finished around noon, stopped in the **Sing Cheong Yuan Bakery** to get some treats and then back to the hotel. Got some coffee at the hotel‚Äôs cafe, and then gathered up our beach gear and walked down to **Waikiki beach** for some more swimming time. Saw more turtles! Back to the hotel to change for dinner.

* **Dinner - back to Tane Vegan Izakaya** for dinner (since not everyone was here the first time). Back to the hotel and then walked down to the beach for the **fireworks**.

**Saturday** \- wake up early to make it to our **Climbworks Keana Farms** for a 3 hour **zipline** tour at 8:40 am (about an hour drive). My mom really wanted to do this ziplining. It was well done and fun and the guides were fun and helpful. If you aren‚Äôt worried about price, I would definitely recommend this activity, especially if you‚Äôve never ziplined before. But at around $180 a person for 3 hours, it was pretty expensive. Drove through the North Shore on the way back. Stopped at shrimp trucks for lunch and **Kuilima Farm Stand** for fruit. Stopped at **Pu'u O Mahuka Heiau State Historic Site** to check out the heiau there, which we enjoyed. Then we drove back to the hotels to regroup.

* **Dinner - Rangoon Burmese Kitchen**, which was really good after a long day. Stopped at the store on the way back so the family could pick up some souvenirs and then said our goodbye!

**Sunday** \- Mom and brother had a flight out in the late morning, had no trouble getting a cab from the hotel and through security and everything. My spouse and I drove to **Kailua** for our final beach day, leaving pretty early in the morning and staying through the early afternoon. The **Turo** was picked up by the owner, super easy hand off.

* We had no dinner reservations planned, so we walked to **Tommy Bahama** for their happy hour. It was fine, but I feel like for the same price you can get much better food in other places.

**Monday** \- Walked to **Sweet E‚Äôs Caf√©** for breakfast. Really like this place, the food was delicious and the staff were super nice. Took the bus back to the hotel. Packed everything up and left the suitcases with the front desk. Walked over the Ala Moana Park and then the center for lunch. Got some pastries at Brug to take on the plane. Walked back to the hotel, got our bags and a Lyft to the airport for our 4pm flight.

Overall, wonderful trip! Super glad I could bring along my mom and brother and show them around to my favorite sites and restaurants.",VisitingHawaii

1682794025.0,Maui trip report - April 2023,"**Stay:** My wife, 2 young kids (5 and under), and I stayed a week at the Honua Kai Resort & Spa located at the westside of Maui for a week. Two things stuck out to me while planning and during the trip: 1. Maui has become so expensive! 2. You need reservations for anything remotely popular. I remember being able to walk into Star Noodle in 2016 (the last time I was in Maui) and get seated right away. For this trip, we had to book couple of weeks in advance and ended up on the waitlist.

Honua Kai is a beautiful resort with nice amenities. We booked this property for their pools, waterslide, near-beach front location, ocean views from the lanai, and the fact they have kitchens inside the units. Parking was easy and check-in/out was also convenient.


**Food:** Most of the food was excellent... For reference: 5/10 is average.

Mala Ocean Tavern: 6.5/10 - Excellent views/location but while the food presentation was nice, I thought their brunch/lunch menu was just pretty good. Had to get reservations.

Mama's Fish House: 8.5/10 - Seems a little low for probably what's the most popular restaurant in Maui and maybe even all of Hawaii? Beautiful location and views, service was top notch, food was great, but not exactly a 10/10 overall experience. I don't know... maybe I set too high expectations, but regardless I'd recommend for everyone to dine at least once here with reservations at least 6 months in advance.

Merrimen's Kapalua: 9.5/10 - An incredible dining experience. The location and service are great and the views are even better. They have a very open air concept so it was still refreshing to sit inside. We dined at Merrimen's in Kauai for my birthday so it was nice to celebrate my wife's at the Merrimen's in Maui. The food was spectacular - my wife and I both cleaned our plates. If you have one big celebration dinner - do it here. Reservations also needed here.

Fish Market Maui: 7/10 - Fresh fish and yummy dishes. Solid choice for lunch or dinner, I just wish they opened later than 7 pm lol.

Thai Food by Suri: 6.5/10 - Not exactly traditional Thai food but a good choice at 8 pm. Food truck.

Da Food Anchor: 5/10 - Ok burger, but good fries. Another food truck.

Hooked: 6/10 - My wife says she's had better poke. Another food truck.

Lahaina Grindz: 6/10 - Chicken Katsu was pretty good. My youngest enjoyed it but I've had better on the island and on the mainland. Another food truck.

Haven's Kahului: 7/10 - Umami burger was delish but the fries were alright. Our first meal after landing was a nice food truck experience.

Kahiau's Poke Truck: 7.5/10 - My wife said it was really good. I don't care much for poke so I'll take her word for it.

Lahaina Ice Cream: 5/10 - Not much to say, just ice cream.

Ululani's Lahina: 7/10 - Loved the ube flavor shave ice. So good!

Ono's Gelato: 5/10 - My kids had like 5 bites and then they were over it. 

Star Noodle: 7.5/10 - Beautiful location - they were not here the first time we visited Maui. It feels funny to say it felt nostalgic eating food from here considering we only ate here twice 7 years ago. The pork buns were my favorite and my wife loved her hot and sour ramen. Kids didn't care for this meal at all haha.

808 Grindz Cafe: 9/10 - LOVED this meal. Very homey taste! Their Kalua hash moco and regular loco moco were fantastic and ube pancakes were amazing. We ate here for lunch and then Merrimen's dinner so that day was the best day ever. 1 hr 45 min wait due to a party of EIGHTEEN that was ahead of us, but well worth the wait.

Blue Ginger Cafe: 6.5/10 - One of the few places open for lunch after our visit to the Cat Sanctuary in Lanai. We also got some yummy ensaimadas here.

**Activities:** We did mostly just pools and other lowkey activities due to the age of our kids. Young kid parent life.

Lanai: Ferry ride there is about 50 minutes, which is about as long as I can stand being on a boat before I perish from the motion sickness. Saw a whale on the ferry ride back. Cool.

Cat Sanctuary: Loved it! My wife had a blast and our boys had fun. If you enjoy cats even a little bit, this is a unique and fun experience. It's free to enter but please donate if you can. I booked through lostonlanai.com

Kaanapali beach: Kids didn't care much for it. All they wanted to do was the water slide and jump into the pool 500 times every day.

Let me know if you guys have any questions.

1668148967.0,Trip Report 11/3-10,"Currently sitting in KOA waiting for my redeye. Here's my trip report.

**About me: 32M, traveling alone**

11/3: Landed in KOA in the evening, some soul mixed up my bag for theirs so I was without my stuff for a good couple hours until they came back. In the meantime, drove to Costco, Safeway, and to my condo (Holua @ Mauna Loa Village).

11/4: In the morning, drove to the Kiholo Bay parking area next to the highway and hiked a short distance to the rocky beach. Saw some goats, but no turtles. Very cloudy day, came back disappointed.

In the evening, went to the harbor near the airport and went Manta Ray viewing. Lost count of the amount of giant flappy boi spaceships that swam within a foot to my face. We weren't allowed to touch them but when they brushed up against us it was like slimy sandpaper. Absolutely unforgettable, along with the worst case of motion sickness in a while (it was very rough water and other souls were puking it out). Didn't think about taking pictures because I was trying too hard to hold in my dinner. Made some friends with a bunch of Alaskan orthodontists.

11/5: Drove 2 hours to Volcanoes National Park in the morning. Pit stop at South Point to go to the bakery and buy a really nice guava donut. Ate lunch in the Desolation Trail parking lot, plenty of space. Hiked from Desolation to cross Kƒ´lauea Iki, to lava tube, then counterclockwise to walk to the Kilauea viewpoint. Pictures don't do justice to just how *massive* the active volcano is. Left as the sun was setting, and the cars were already queued for the nighttime showing. Two hour drive back in time for dinner.

11/6: Had the morning off to stay in and chill. Afternoon guided excursion to the top of Mauna Kea. The view were priceless, but the altitude sickness hit me like a semi on a Kansas interstate. Had to walk like a grandma to avoid passing out. Stargazing at night, but I made the mistake of booking my trip the night the moon was at its brightest. Stargazing visibility was comparable to a bustling city, but without the shimmer. Almost puked from the rocky road down at night.

11/7: Drove to KOA to fly a cessna up to the north tip of the island. Cliffs were beautiful, but they weren't as dramatic as Kauai. Flew over the east side and my instructor pointed to all the smaller beaches I should go to. Ended up going to Kekaha Kai. **Disclaimer: I was in a mid-sedan and gave up on the unpaved road a couple hundred feet in. Walked a couple miles across a lava field in the middle of the day. Beach was worth it but it was a trek to walk there.** Spent a couple hours walking around and soaking in the sights. A couple local teenagers took pity on me during my walk back and let me hitch a ride to my car. (Is this reverse stranger danger??). Lovely dinner at Umeke's, but I was seated at the bar and wasn't impressed by the drunk sugar daddies trying to act cultured.

11/8: Morning snorkel at Capt. Cook with Fair Winds. Mostly kept to myself on the massive boat but the snorkeling was a lot of fun. My iPhone took trash pictures though. Tour guide that was lifeguarding the water slides was really cute. No evening plans.

11/9: Bright and early drive to Umauma Falls zip lining. Tour guides were great, and the entire experience felt very safe. Unfortunately I discovered zip lining isn't my thing, left disappointed. Two hour drive back to try to catch (and miss) the sunset at Kua Bay. **Fail of the day: I had a second snorkel tour for the following afternoon but was starting to feel uneasy at the thought of being offshore when I had a plane to catch at night. Rebooked for a morning boat but had to pay for my cancelled reservation in full.** Also bought a GoPro at Target (on sale, and I was on the fence for months).

11/10: Morning snorkel at Capt Cook (again) but thoroughly enjoyed it. Small fast boat this time, and the other seven participants were best friend retirees from Florida. Took full advantage of the GoPro to make some nice pictures.

Afternoon spent at Monarch Coffee Farm, where the guides were an absolute treat.

Evening spent at Kua Bay successfully catching the sunset (and awkwardly asking strangers to take my picture). Got some very solid shots that I hope aren't blurred. Caught a picture of a German tourist's head silhouetting the sun, will email him a copy when I get back home.

**Pros**

Entire trip was without question a success.

Locals, transplants, and most tourists were very pleasant people .

Manta Rays!

Most people here are Asian and I partially fit in. For once, I didn't feel like a foreigner. 

Seeing fishies

Used hats, rash guards and an entire bottle of thicc sunscreen, didn't get a single sunburn. Still had opportunities to not wear a shirt, and still got mosquito bites.

Plenty to do, but my schedule didn't feel stressfully hectic. 

Jealous of how laid back some of the locals are, some really acting up the surfer bro stereotype.

**Cons**

Getting seasick, airsick, and carsick. 

Red eye flight back

Absolutely shit internet at my condo, including cellular coverage.

Turned on Bumble, got flaked for several meetups. Shouldn't really expect anything from that though

Morning and evening Kona traffic is frustrating

**What I want to do next time (if there's a next time)**

Mauna Kea, but with my own 4x4

Stargazing without the moon obscuring everything

Horseback riding

More Manta Rayliottas!

Scuba diving (after getting a cert)

Black sand beaches

Macadamia Nut factory

Kilauea at night

The problem? It's on the big island (Hawai'i) and we are on Oahu. It's a shame because she was really looking forward to going. Unfortunately, there's no refunds unless it gets re-booked, which is why I'm posting here. It's supposed to be a super cool thing with only like 6 people on the tour and she was lucky to get it because she booked early and was going alone (ocean at night isn't my thing).  


The original cost total was $116. If you take our spot so we get a refund, I'll even kick you $20 via paypal/venmo, bringing your cost <$100. When booking online, under ""How did you hear about us"", just put ""Other"" and then put ""Littleberry"" in the next text field.

1655412857.0,Post Trip Review,"Just got back from my trip to Oahu a couple days ago and want to thank everyone for asking/answering questions, and posting itineraries. My family and I had the best time, I was not ready to leave lol!

Trip Highlights:

* Kayaking to the Mokes: We booked a 5 hour kayaking tour with Kailua Beach Adventures and it was amazing. I was super intimidated at first as I have never kayaked before but the tour guides were great. They made everyone feel safe and did not leave anyone behind. They were so informative and gave us a little bits of Hawaiian history that was greatly appreciated. We also got to snorkel on the island and saw sea turtles.
* Kualoa ATV Tour: The ranch is absolutely breathtaking, and the tour was an absolute blast. Got super dusty, which almost made it more fun? Guides were super knowledgeable about not only the movies that were shot there but of the land itself.
* Moana Falls: The views before the actual upward hike after coming out of the cargo bridge made me feel like I was in a majestic dream. I have never seen something so beautiful.
* Iolani Palace Tour: I unknowingly booked this tour on the same day as King Kamehameha Day so were able to catch part of the parade as it started off from there. The docent was very knowledgeable about all the items in the palace and what took place there. 

Other takeaways:

* I loved how not only all of the tour guides were knowledgable about different aspects of Hawaii, but that they were really passionate and cared deeply to learn the land/history. It really elevated the experience as I got pieces of information about Hawaii all throughout the trip.
* Love that there is shave ice literally everywhere, miss it already.
* Wear and apply sun screen constantly! I burned my most of my face, as well as my lips got so swollen (avoid vaseline).
* Love the beaches, I was excited to find a lot of calm beaches that I could pretty much relax in without the fear of the waves taking me outward. 

Also, I am super interested in reading more about Hawaii, does anyone have any good book recommendations? I recently purchased Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen.",VisitingHawaii
1653847887.0,Oahu 8 Day Trip Review. Thanks for one of the best weeks of my life!,"We just got back from our 8 day Oahu trip and loved every second of it! Just wanted to do a review of the trip.

[I had posted in HawaiiVisitors](https://www.reddit.com/r/HawaiiVisitors/comments/tqcfe9/oahu_frist_time_visitors_please_review_our_8_day/) and received a lot of help with my itinerary.

&nbsp;


We stayed in Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki. This was a great hotel for the price. Close to International Market Place. We parked our rental car at Waikiki Banyan for $150/week.

&nbsp;

**Best experiences:**&nbsp;

**Diamond Head, Koko Head, Moana Falls and Lanikai Pillbox hikes:** Oahu is one of the best hiking places in the world! Loved Moana Falls' rainforest vibe. Koko Head was a good test of my fitness. The view from top of Lanikai Pillbox was one of the best I have ever seen.

**Lanikai Beach:** Insanely beautiful beach. We chilled here for half a day.

**Kualoa Ranch ATV tour:** The ATV tour was one of the best experiences of my life. The view were insane and the guides were incredibly knowledgeable.
&nbsp;

**[Hawaiian Parasail](https://hawaiianparasail.com/)**: Won't ever forget 1000 feet up on a clear sunny day looking at Waikiki and Diamond Head.
&nbsp;


**Pearl Harbor & Battleship Missouri:** Interesting to visit as a huge history buff. The National Park rangers were amazing and told us a bunch of stories.
&nbsp;

**Bishop Museum & Iolani Palace:** Learned a lot about Hawaiian history. 
&nbsp;

**Byodo-In Temple:** Incredibly spiritual place. Also went to Ho ªomaluhia Botanical Garden which is closeby.
&nbsp;

**Hanauma Bay**: We were lucky to get tickets by checking the website at 7AM exactly. I am not a strong swimmer but my cousin snorkeled there and loved it!

&nbsp;

**Best food:**

**Haleiwa Joe's Haiku Gardens:** Highly recommend for a special dinner. The view from the restaurant is magical.

**Hula Grill Waikiki:** Amazing sunset view and cocktails. We listened to live music from Duke's below.
&nbsp;

**Sweet E's Cafe and Cinnamons:** Oahu's brunch game is on point!

**Kono's Northshore:** Best budget option and close to out hotel. Those Chuns bombers and mudpie milkshakes! We went several times.

**Matsumoto Shave Ice:** Best shaved ice on Oahu. Long line but moves fast.

**Highway Inn Kaka'ako:** Tried the tasting plate to check out everything. I am obsessed with Loco Mocos now.


**Leonard‚Äôs Bakery:** We liked all the different flavors of malasadas. Carb up here before your hikes lol.

**Katsumidori Sushi Tokyo:** Creative rolls and the price is decent.
&nbsp;

**Marugame Udon, Musubi Cafe, Maguro Brothers, Dole Plantation's Dole Whip, Monkeypod, Yard House, Seven Bros and Giovanni's Shrimp** were great as well.

I have been to several top foodie cities in the U.S. like New Orleans, San Francisco, Chicago and NYC. I thought the food in Oahu would be just okay but I was thoroughly impressed!

* Arrived in Kona. Picked up grocery order from Walmart. Highly recommend buying coffee/breakfast if you're traveling from the East Coast; we consistently woke up between 3:30-5am, and coffee shops don't open until 6:30-8am
* Dinner and drinks at *Kona Brewing* \- great beers and okay food in a lush backyard patio setting

**Day 2: Exploring Hawaii Volcanos National Park**

* Traveled from Kona through Hilo to arrive at *Mt. View Bakery* around 7:30am. Picked up a bag of their original stone cookies (wish we'd bought 2, they're great with coffee), mochi donuts (taro flavor was especially good), and a cinnamon raisin sweet roll 
* Spent the day at Hawaii Volcanos National Park (8:30am-3:30pm)
   * Drove *Chain of Craters Road* \- cool drive to see geological features. Stopped at lava flows and overlooks during the drive
   * Hiked *Kilauea Iki Trail* \- 3.2 mile, moderately difficult hike from native forests across an enormous dried lava lake. It's a hot and rocky walk across the lava lake, and the forests provided a cooler, more humid reprieve. Easily found parking at 9:15am
   * Walked the *Thurston Lava Tube* \- crowded but interesting. Saw people struggling to navigate puddles in the dark in flip flops. Wear sneakers or hiking boots to avoid that trouble. Hike to the lava tube from Kilauea Iki to avoid parking twice
   * Left the park to eat lunch at *Cafe Ono*, a veggie restaurant <15 mins from the park
   * Bailed on *Maunaulu Eruption Trail* \- tried to hike this trail, but it was difficult to follow across the lava (ahu or random pile of rocks?!) and hot
   * Hiked to *Pu'uloa* \- 1.5 mile hike that felt every bit of its length. Fully exposed walk across the lava field to see awesome Hawaiian petroglyphs. Again, sneakers or hiking boots are better than flip flops
* Drove to Kona along the southern part of the island. Didn't stop at the southernmost point or black sand beach, but these are good options depending on energy levels
* Ate at *Teshima* in Kealakekua - super Japanese; fresh ahi and some of the best tempura I've had

**Day 3: Snorkeling and visiting Waimea**

* Went on a 4-hour snorkeling trip with *Kona Ocean Adventures* \- cannot say enough good things about this operator. Near-private tour with 4 clients and 2 crew. Stopped at Kealakekua Bay. Saw whales, bottlenose dolphins, spinner dolphins, and a manta ray while we were on the water
* Picked up coffee from *Hula Daddy Coffee* \- award-winning 100% Kona coffee from a family-run operation
* Stopped at *Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site* on our way to Waimea - great way to learn about Hawaiian history. 30 min walking tour available on our phone told the history of the site and more
* Ate at *Merriman's Waimea* \- incredible tasting menu with great cocktails. Dreamt of the honey lilikoi mai tai. Highlight meal on the Big Island!

**Day 4: Hiking Pu'u Wa'awa'a and stargazing at Mauna Kea**

* Hiked the *Pu‚Äôu Wa‚Äôawa‚Äôa Cinder Cone Trail*, which took \~3 hours. Added the 0.5 mile walk through the ohi'a on the way up and stuck to the paved road on the way down. Fantastic views of 5 volcanos (it was a clear day, so we could see Haleakala), but hard-earned. Take plenty of water and a snack for the benches at the summit
* Picked up lunch at *Pau Hana Poke* \- just one table of seating available, so we opted to eat at our condo
* Went stargazing at Mauna Kea on *Hawaii Forests & Trails' Maunakea Summit & Stars* tour. 12:1 guest:guide ratio, relatively luxurious bus, knowledgeable guide, new parkas, warm gloves, surprisingly tasty dinner, cookies, and cocoa, and fabulous sunset and star views. The road to the summit is not for the faint of heart (or easily carsick), and I did notice the altitude. Snow on the ground in mid-March makes hiking boots a good choice

**Day 5: Traveling to Maui**

* Ate dinner at *Monkeypod Kitchen by Merriman* because I needed another one of those mai tais :D Happy hour from 3:30-5pm every day

**Day 6: Relaxing at the beach and visiting Mama's Fish House**

* Spent the morning at *Keawakapu Beach* \- free parking (search Kilohana Parking Lot) and a clean, wide sandy beach. Lots of people out swimming, snorkeling, and walking when we were there
* Ate at *Mama's Fish House* \- fabulous food if you can get a reservation. We booked our res \~9 months out. I had the curry and would order it again in a heartbeat

**Day 7: Exploring upcountry and Haleakala**

* Had breakfast at *Kihei Cafe* \- big portions, great egg dishes, better waffles than pancakes IMO. Add the bananas and macadamia nuts if you're a fan of those flavors. There are roosters and hens walking around while you eat. Aside from the occasional crow, they aren't disruptive
* Drove upcountry to explore more of Maui
   * Tried donuts on a stick from *Komoda Store and Bakery*. Glazed was better than cinnamon sugar. Makawao is a cute town to walk around
   * Stopped at *Maui Bees* for honey and jun, a kombucha-like drink made from green tea and honey. Gorgeous farm behind the farm stand with lush greenery and trees blooming
   * Lots of little farm stands beside the road selling local produce
* Drove to *Haleakala* \- Since we'd just seen sunset from Mauna Kea (and were used to waking up at 5 instead of 3am), we opted out of Haleakala at sunrise. Took us 1.5 hours to drive from Maui Bees to the summit. This is another drive that tests the driver's nerves, especially on a clear day. Use a low gear (instead of riding the brake) on the drive down! 

**Day 8: Relaxing at the beach and enjoying our last meals/treats in Hawaii**

* Spent the day at *Kamaole Beach Park III*, a beach that was close to our condo. It was nice to have life guards on duty, though the water was clear and calm while we were there
* Picked up shaved ice from *Ululani's Hawaiian Shave Ice* in Kihei. The fruit flavors and mochi were fresh, but I'm not sure it was worth the 45 min wait
* Ate dinner at *Da Nani Pirates*, part of *Kihei Food Truck Park* \- highly recommend the ahi tacos and curly fries. There are a bunch of food trucks here and a seating area with picnic benches, so this would be a great pick if you have a big group

1670632110.0,Literally Awesome,"My band got back from Hawaii last week and boy was the money worth it. The trip was beautiful, we ate such good food, and preforming was mind blowing. 

We preformed in the Waikiki holiday parade and that was probably my favorite part of the trip. I have never preformed around such energy and excitement before and the local bands were so kind and such amazing performers. Our local parade is, of course, much smaller scale, but it was a genuinely life changing experience to preform for not only that large amount of people, but also be surrounded by all this joy that we were shown. If there is anyone reading this who attended that parade, thank you for making it a once in a lifetime experience, and if you happened to be in it, I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did!!

The burning question I'm sure no one is wondering, will I ever go back? Probably not. It's a lot of money that I just don't see myself having in the future and I know a lot of locals aren't exactly super happy about tourists. But, I guess the trip being genuinely once in a lifetime was part of what made it special. 

We hiked the Diamond Head trail, and as horrible it was getting up as someone with some pretty messed up knees, it was so worth it once we got to the top and the way down wasn't bad at all. 

O'ahu was beautiful and I loved just walking around the island. My band absolutely loved the Polynesian Cultural Center and if your thinking of going, DO IT!! It was so cool to see and the Ha Breath of Life Show was one of the best pieces of art I have ever seen, all the performers are so so talented.

Overall, I have a lot of really positive things to say, and my only complaint was that I didn't get to do as much as I originally wanted to and due to time the bands beach cleanup activity had to be canceled. But, over all, 10/10, I would love to go again... in maybe 30 years when I theoretically have disposable income to spend on a trip :P",VisitingHawaii

1694394241.0,Our Kaua‚Äôi Itinerary,"We recently visited Kaua‚Äôi and found so much helpful information on here for our trip that I‚Äôm returning the favor. 

Day 1: Waimea, Poipu

Waimea Canyon National Park: Waimea canyon lookout (got an awesome history lesson from a native Hawaiian here), kalalau lookout, puu o kila lookout, pu‚Äôuhinahina lookout. Gorgeous drive, go on a day when it‚Äôs clear. Awesome view of the Napali coast at the last lookout. 

Puka Dogs 8/10: good but nothing I‚Äôd rave about. It‚Äôs a quick bite to eat by the beach 

Snorkeling at Poipu Beach: really awesome. Take your own snorkel gear and wear some water shoes. Tons of fish to see and it‚Äôs free. Also recommend some liquid bandage in case you get banged up on the coral

Bubbas Burgers 9/10: delicious burger and fries we ended up going here a couple times 

Lapperts Ice Cream 9/10: get the 5 half scoops for $10 in the waffle bowl. Pretty great value. Went here a few times 

Spouting horn: cool to watch

Kiahuna Beach: nice beach but huge waves

Day 2: Lihue, Kapa‚Äôa

Wailua falls: can only see it behind a fence and it‚Äôs not a great view at that. Very limited parking but it‚Äôs a quick sight so spots open fast

Kauai Bakery 8/10: malasadas are great, especially the Nutella filled one

Sleeping giant trail: one of my favorite things we did. Keep going past the covered shelter and up a slightly sketchy rock wall. Feels like you‚Äôre one top of the world. 

Wailua shave ice 10/10: you have to get the Ube shaved ice with vanilla ice cream. Amazing

Kauai backcountry tubing adventure: this was so cool and fun. Would definitely do it again. 

Smileys local grinds 10/10: delicious. We really liked the kalbi and smileys chicken

Day 3: Hanalei

Holey grail donuts 5/10: this was highly recommended and we were super disappointed. $4 for 4 bites of a very average donut. We have better donuts at our local Kroger 

Village Snack Shop and Bakery 3/10: waited 40 minutes for a very basic meal. Was pretty disappointed

Tunnels beach: pretty cool coral tunnels but felt like we saw more fish at Poipu and parking was hard to find. 

Hanalei beach: most beautiful beach I‚Äôve ever been too. Great sand, surrounded by mountains, calm water, cool boats. 

Wishing well shave ice 7/10: good but nothing to go back to

Wishing well coffee 8/10: very smooth coffee and get a cute mason jar to take home

Day 4: Poipu and Kapa‚Äôa

Mahalueka Heritage Trail to Makauwahi cave: stunning views, lots of different landscapes, easy trail

Da crack 7/10: good size burrito, definitely shareable. Flavor was just okay

Poipu beach again

Brenneckes Snack Shack shave ice 10/10: really good shave ice, make sure to add the ice cream

El Rey Del Mar food truck 10/10: hands down best tacos. Our group got baha fish, baha shrimp and Al pastor and all were amazing and loaded up. 

Wailua shave ice again

Day 5: NƒÅpali, Koloa, Poipu 

Kauai Kookie 9/10: good bakery items at a good price. Their cinnamon sugar malasadas are really good

NƒÅpali coast boat tour with Makana Charters: we were on the NƒÅpali Kai III and it was a great boat. Captain and staff were fun to talk to, knowledgeable, took us into some fun caves, saw tons of waterfalls and had a good lunch and snorkeling at the end. Gorgeous boat tour and fun day

Chalupa cart in Koloa 7/10: got the carne asada burrito. It was good, not great. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend 

Craving Thai cart 7/10: also just okay, nothing to rave about 

Savage shrimp in Poipu 7/10: kinda disappointing after going to El Rey

Day 6: Kapa‚Äôa, Hanapepe, Poipu

Kuilau Ridge trail: beautiful trail and scenery. Pretty muddy so wear crappy shoes 

El rey Del Mar again. Wish we had eaten here more

Wailua shave ice again

Salt pond beach in Hanapepe: Cool beach but wish we‚Äôd gone up to Hanalein Beach one more time

Brenneckes Snack Shack shave ice again

Sunset at Poipu beach: beautiful and the sea turtles come in. A bit crowded at sunset 

Kiawe roots 8/10: this came highly recommended. We might have ordered wrong because it was death by meat but it was good. Really liked the Mac n cheese

Edit to add: pay attention to hours of restaurants. We found that a lot of places closed early. And book in advance if you can for the tours. We did book the tubing tour 2 days in advance and there was plenty of openings however. Also, if you have souvenirs to buy, check out Walmart first. Same items as the other shops but way less expensive.",VisitingHawaii

1673113252.0,Kauai trip report,"FOOD:

Kenji burger - awesome bowls and good prices, there are a few locations, but only on Kauai. I loved this place. We ate at two different  locations.

Living foods - fresh healthy choices, we had reservations, can be busy

Brennecke's at Poipu Beach - casual dining, good sandwiches and bowls, a little pricey, but great location.

Hefat shave ice - good shave ice

Jo Jo's shave ice - we thought this was best

Rum Fire at Sheraton - great food, high prices. Butterfish was the specialty and worth it. Live music at night

Lava at Sheraton - casual dining on the beach. Good food and service. Live music at night.

Keokis Paradise - stunning environment, wonderful food. Reservations recommended. Several different fish preparations. We had Mahi and Black Marlin. 

LODGING:

We stayed at the Sheraton Resort near Poipu. Great room and service. We had an ocean view. The local beach was OK, but usually crowded. Same with the pool/hot tub. Good location to allow us to access both sides of the island.

ACTIVITIES:

Capt Andy's Napali coast boat cruise/dinner, better than hotel convention food, not steak house quality. It was kind of crowded with limited seating. Grab a seat before they start serving food. Three passengers out of fifty got sea sick, probably average. We saw multiple whales and a pod of dolphins. It was very cloudy along the coast, only got partial views. Unsure about the value.

Pihea mountain from Waimea lookout. Like most hikes on Kauai, it was slippery and muddy. Constant drizzle and clouds blocked all views. We made it to the summit and got back without falling down so success. 2.3 miles round trip.

Wailua river kayak and hike to the ""secret"" falls. There is nothing secret about the falls, with a dozen guided trips every day. 2.1 mile paddle, 1.3 mile hike on an easy trail. The falls were nice, maybe 150',  but it was way too crowded. Can't recommend. Better things to do.

Hanakapi'ai Falls - This was an awesome hike. We rode the shuttle to the parking lot/trailhead ($35/person). Two mile hike to the beach where there are more restrooms, then another two miles on rougher terrain to the 300' falls. The falls were amazing. Multiple stream crossings, I think four we had to wade through knee deep water. Some scrambling toward the end. 8 miles round trip, about 2000' gain. Took us 5 hours. I think this was my favorite activity.

Sleeping Giant/Nounou hike - The prominent mountain above the Wailua River. There is an east and west trail. We took the east trail. A couple of scramble sections at the top. Best views from the ""chin"". Cement block and pole on the summit. About 3.3 miles round trip.

Poipu Beach - Our favorite beach. Many turtles and a sleeping monk seal. It was fairly busy, but not overcrowded. Gentle water for swimming and snorkeling.

Did not do any helicopter tours. We had the most fun exploring on our own.",VisitingHawaii
1652077271.0,"I survived a week without being assaulted by Ezra Miller, and you can too.","So for those of you who, like me, are concerned about the scourge plaguing Hawaii, that is Ezra Miller, don't let it put you off. My partner and I last week wrapped up a week long trip to Hawaii, including a day trip to the big island, and did not get assaulted by Ezra Miller.

&#x200B;

Just take some simple precautions.  


**If you see Ezra Miller**, do not engage. Avoid eye contact and just keep on walking.  


**The chairs at Hilo Airport** might look comfortable, but they're ripe for Ezra Miller to throw at you. AVOID THOSE CHAIRS.  


**If you hear emergency vehicle sirens**, it's best to move away from them as there's a good chance they're heading toward Ezra Miller.

&#x200B;

Some of the activities we did where Ezra Miller was not present include.  


[Bishop Museum](https://www.bishopmuseum.org/). Great spot to learn about Polynesian history and hide from Ezra Miller.  


[Experience Nutridge Luau](https://www.experiencenutridge.com/). Great food, better entertainment. Held on Pu'u 'Ualaka'a or ""Rolling sweet potato hill"" perfect for rolling Ezra Miller down if you can get the high ground.  


[Ohana Island Creations](https://ohanaislandcreations.com/). Wood carver with beautiful large pieces and plenty of smaller pieces to take home. Shave ice place next door does a fantastic pineapple shave ice. Plenty of hiding places if Ezra Miller pulls in while you're there.

[808 Gun Club](https://808gunclub.com/). If, like me, you're from a country with half-decent gun laws, and want to get in on some of that second amendment action, these guys are great. Super friendly and eager to make sure you have a good time (while also staying safe), I feel like this is possibly the best place you can be during the Ezra Miller saga.

[Mauka Makai Adventures](https://maukamakaiadventures.com/) (Big Island Volcano Tour). We flew in in the morning and flew out in the evening, so I booked us a tour to get out to Volcanoes National Park rather than wing it. Josh, the guide, was fantastic. Very knowledgeable and knew all the right places to go. Tours aren't usually my thing, but it saved me having to do too much research before our day trip. This is probably the biggest risk we took when it comes to Ezra Miller, so stay alert, stay safe.

Did heaps more, but I'm not going to spend an hour writing something a dozen or so people will see. Only thing I can add is, if you're Australian, make sure you visit Outback Steakhouse. Cringiest shit you'll ever see, but good for a laugh.

1665965928.0,Post Cancer Win Family Vacation! Looking For Recommendations! :),"Hello r/VisitingHawaii! I am looking for some advice/travel tips for a family trip coming up in late November. 

My mom just spent the last 1.5  years battling stage 4 cancer and won! Doctor has cleared her for travel, so my family is taking a vacation to Kona, but none of us have been before! I am hoping to get some local recommendations on food & things to do as a family (all adults) that isn't extremely physical - we will be renting a vehicle, as hiking is probably not going to be an option (shorter, lower intensity ones should be ok).   


So far I have come across:   
\-Manta ray night dive/snorkel 

\-Mauna Kea volcano 

\-Punalulu black sand beach 

\-Rainbow falls 

\-Kona coffee 

\-Lava Tubes

Also, is there an equivalent by any chance to mamas fish from Maui on Kona? That was a favourite in previous travels.   


Any and all recommendations greatly appreciated! :)",VisitingHawaii
1652814938.0,"Trip report - 5 nights, 4 (jam-packed) days on the Big Island inc. Jeep Camping!","Hey all! We just wrapped up a 5 night, 4 day trip to the Big Island and I thought I‚Äôd share our experience; this sub was so helpful when I was planning our trip, and I hope this can help some others.

I want to preface this by saying my husband and I have a hard time sitting still for long, and we are frequent road trippers - we like to take in as much as we can when visiting a new place, so we packed a ton into this visit. Others may enjoy slowing down and seeing less; for us, we don‚Äôt know how often we will get to get out to HI from South Carolina, so we went hard, while also being very intentional about ‚Äústopping to smell the plumerias‚Äù as much as possible. We are also vegan, which I mention only for those who may be searching that term to be able to find this post - we found it very easy to get amazing food everywhere we went on the island! 

So - after taking four planes in a day, we landed in Kona around 7pm last Wednesday. We took a taxi to our resort, Royal Kona, which we just booked to have a place to sleep the first night. We were surprised to be upgraded to an oceanfront room and enjoyed the sound of the crashing waves outside. We walked to Huggo‚Äôs, which was a bit of a disappointment (food was crazy expensive and bland), but there wasn‚Äôt much open around 8:30pm, so we had to take what we could get. We really were not into the loud, drunk tourists who seemed to be next to us everywhere we went and crowded spaces in that part of town, and couldn‚Äôt wait to get out. 

In the morning, we walked to a coffee shop, then to the Kona farmer‚Äôs market, which was more souvenirs than farmed goods. We walked to Herbivore‚Äôs, a cute little vegan restaurant, and loved it. Then, we got an Uber to pick us up - with the nicest Uber driver we‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶he had 4000+ trips and 5 star rating, and we could see why! Aloha spirit all the way. He took us to grab our luggage from the hotel, and then took us to the parking lot across from the airport to meet Matt from Hawaii Campervan, who went over our Jeep camper rental with us. 15 minutes of that and we were on our way!

Our first stop on Thursday after getting the Jeep was Kiholo Bay, where we went to see the Queen‚Äôs bath. So, so cool. I had sandals on, and it became clear quite quickly that I needed something like Teva‚Äôs to walk on the rocky beaches (and eventually go in the water at certain beaches), so we swung into a shop north of Kiholo Bay to grab some. After that, we stopped by Hapuna beach, and we were blown away by the crystal clear water and powder white sand; absolutely stunning. We continued on, stopping at the Macadamia Nut Factory to grab some Mac nuts, then to a country store called Kohala Grown to grab some provisions for our trip. It was the perfect store for our needs, with lots of vegan options, locally grown produce, locally made artisan products like bread and tortilla chips and popcorn and meal items, and more. We drove to Pololu Valley, hiked down into it, and enjoyed the beauty of it for a while before heading back up and driving the beautiful road to Honokaa. 

Just past Honokaa, we stopped at the cutest Lillinoe Fruit Stand to meet our Hipcamp host for the night, and we followed him down a 4x4 road for about 20 minutes to get to the campsite. Guys - anyone reading this who is looking to camp on the Big Island, you‚Äôve gotta book it (as long as you have 4x4). It‚Äôs $100 a night which is steep for a campsite, but it‚Äôs worth it. Erik the host is the absolute coolest, kindest, friendliest, most full-of-aloha guy you‚Äôll ever meet, and the land-which allows both sunrise AND sunset views over the ocean, which you can see Maui from on a clear day, which you can spot Waipi‚Äôo Valley from-has been in his family forever. He‚Äôs got incredible stories and his passion for the land is so strong and contagious. The views were insane, and we ended up cancelling our Hipcamp for another place the following night just to stay one more night there. DM me for details about this spot, would gladly share.

After a great night sleeping in the jeep and taking in the views, we traveled to Akaka Falls on Friday, which didn‚Äôt disappoint. I was picturing an overrun touristy spot, but we got there early enough that we had it to ourselves and the hike through was gorgeous. After that, we took the Pepeekeo scenic route to Hilo, where we enjoyed the farmer‚Äôs market and went to a joint Vegan Restaurant and Mattress Shop. Weird, but the food was so good! It‚Äôs literally called ‚ÄúVegan Shop‚Äù and he does a vegan version of Hawaiian Plate Lunch. We went to Carlsmith Park hoping to see some sea turtles after that. No luck, but nice snorkeling. Then, we went to Makanis Magic Pineapple shop for a√ßa√≠ bowls, and drove to the visitor‚Äôs center at Mauna Kea and hung out there for a while before descending and driving through a road that looked like Scotland back to Honokaa by way of Waimea. The insane topography and climate changes this day were so fun to witness! We got back to the campsite in time for a sunset and enjoyed another night on the northern cliffs. 

Saturday, we woke up early and packed up the campsite, then drove to Hilo, taking the Pepeekeo scenic route again. We went back  to the Hilo Farmer‚Äôs Market and were shocked at the difference between Friday and Saturday‚Äôs markets - Saturday was so, so much bigger and way more fun. We enjoyed trying so many new (to us) tropical fruits and buying from local artists and artisans, skipping over some of the souvenirs booths and meeting some actual artists behind some handmade works. From there, we went to Rainbow Falls, then Boiling Pots, and then made our way up to Volcano NP, where we did chain of craters road and Thurston Lava tube. We left HVNP and headed to Punaalu black sand beach in hopes of seeing turtles and we did see one, much to my happiness! We ended up sitting about 20 feet from the sweet turtle and just peacefully watched it for about 30 minutes - one of the most incredible moments of my life for sure, just to watch such a wild animal. We drove down to Captain Cool after that, staying in an Airbnb near the bay (a surprise for my husband - I figured we‚Äôd enjoy a day to ‚Äúspread out‚Äù) and watched the sun set over the ocean while checking out all the cool shells and sea glass. 

Sunday morning, we woke up and went snorkeling at Manini Beach, then went to the Kona Green Market farmer‚Äôs market and tried some delicious food and watched some live music. We swung into Coffee Shack, but it was super busy and the wait was long, so we kept going. We went to Two Step to do a little more snorkeling, and it definitely lives up to its hype. We had an absolute blast, but I‚Äôd recommend a pool noodle or other float if you‚Äôre not a super strong swimmer, as you want to stay off the coral, of course! I borrowed one from someone and had an infinitely better time than without one. We got some poke from Honaunau Poke Shop nearby (lots of veg options!) and stopped for shave ice between there and Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation. We did the little tour, which was fine, and bought some things from the gift shop before heading to our campsite. Our campsite was a boondock site just north of the Kona airport suggested to us by our camper jeep company, who gave us the coordinates, and we had to travel down a very rough road for nearly 45 minutes to get there. Honestly, if the jeep had not been specifically outfitted for a ride like this (with a bunch of aftermarket stuff including massive all terrain tires and a sizeable lift), I don‚Äôt think it would have made it - we passed a regular jeep trying to make the trek and it was clearly too low to do it. The very, very bumpy and occasionally harrowing ride was worth it, though, because we had a beautiful beach all to ourselves at the end, with an epic sunset. 

Monday morning, our 9am flight got delayed an hour, so we took the crazy ‚Äúroad‚Äù back up to the main road and booked it to Hapuna Beach for a quick swim one more time before heading to the airport and taking off.

I know this is a lot‚Ä¶hopefully it helps someone! We knocked off SO many of our bucket list items and I feel like we really ‚Äúgot our money‚Äôs worth‚Äù while being able to still sit and spend time in the moments we wanted. :) Feel free to ask any questions!",VisitingHawaii

1668375846.0,Pearl Harbor trip report with pragmatics.,"This is long, but I wanted to include a lot of the practical details to help others. 

**Prelude**

We had no problem signing up for Arizona Memorial reservations. We already had the recreation.gov account and app set up. Using the web site, you can easily find the 60 day mark for the day you want to visit.  On the east coast, reservation slots are released at 9PM EDT (8PM when we switch to EST). So we just set a reminder to tell us to book the reservations. There was no mad banging on the keyboard (unlike Disney dining reservations). 

We chose 10AM. This gave us a comfortable buffer for eating breakfast and getting to Pearl Harbor without panicking, while not forcing a mid-day break in routine to take the boat to the memorial. 

**Day of our visit**

We stayed at Hilton Hawaiian Village.  We picked our first full day on Oahu as our Pearl Harbor day, but had the previous afternoon to get the lay of the land. We kept our biological clocks closer to California time, helping us get up early and get to bed early.

Got up around 5:30, sat down to breakfast around 7:05 at CJ‚Äôs just after they opened. Grabbed a Lyft that picked us up at 8:06 (about a 10 minute wait) and arrived at Pearl Harbor around 8:45.  It took a few minutes to find the hotel‚Äôs designated rideshare pickup spot, from where we ordered the Lyft. 

At Pearl Harbor, I was prepared for a full TSA-style pat down, but getting in was trivial. We had a clear plastic stadium backpack for water bottles (not transparent) and camera stuff, and wore cargo shorts for other items. But all the guard did was to ask to look at both sides of the backpack and then wave us in. In retrospect, I probably could have brought my camera battery wallet (about 6 inches long).  As it turned out, there was a water main break, essentially making the water fountains non-potable and our water bottles useless that day.  

The [map page](https://www.nps.gov/perl/planyourvisit/maps.htm) doesn‚Äôt have the maps well labeled. The lower map is the main visitor center area, and is the part in the upper map labeled ‚ÄúPearl Harbor National Memorial‚Äù (on Oahu proper). As you can see, the submarine museum is right there at the north end (on the right after the entrance gates). 

I was surprised to see a huge standby line for the Arizona. I had thought they had stopped doing that. There was well over 100 people on line around 9AM hoping to get in.  Since the line didn‚Äôt make sense, I walked past it and found the entrance line for people with reservations along with the sign identifying the standby line.  The reservation line was empty as they had already seated people for the 9AM boat in the theater.  

I regret not asking one of the rangers how the standby line functioned. Since admission to the memorial is free, consider this if you weren‚Äôt able to book reservations but can show up very early to the site.  By the time of our reservation, the standby line had shrunk to maybe 50, and was nonexistent later. 

We used our time before the reservation to see the Attack exhibit (one of two small museums near the theater and boarding area for the Arizona) as well as the outside exhibit (the entire loop containing the points labeled Contemplation Circle and Remembrance Circle on the map). We went to the reservation line around 9:45 and were seated in the theater immediately, able to get center seats. 

Two things were non-standard about our introduction before boarding. First, because of repairs on the pier, they‚Äôre only using one boarding area and not having people see their short film about the attack before boarding. Second, rather than whatever usual ranger talk they normally had, we were joined by a school group, I‚Äôd guess 5th or 6th graders, and the teacher led a discussion with them. She did a mix of asking her students about facts and about feelings, comparing the attack to bullying, but also mentioning the oil embargo against Japan. (I believe the students, unlike most of the rest of us, saw the film first.)  As someone who‚Äôs long out of school, I felt truly lucky and privileged to experience that rather than the stock ranger talk. (Not that the rangers are bad.  We have plenty of national historic sites in Massachusetts and the rangers are always excellent.  The ones that helped out the teacher were too.)  

We then boarded the boat. Pay attention to the rangers about both boarding lines being open. I luckily grabbed a picture of the Arizona Memorial building when we were close to its dock, since they didn‚Äôt want anyone pausing for pictures on the dock until after everyone was off the boat. But don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs time to come outside while the boat is away. 

I won‚Äôt say much about the memorial itself, other than my being choked up at times. Do listen to any talk given in the shrine section. One of the displays helped orient myself with regard to the ship, and patience allowed me to see more of the ship underwater. 

When we got back, we quickly used the bathroom and then picked up the shuttle bus (to the right of the museum) and took it to the USS Missouri, moored at Ford Island. At the Missouri, we had a nice lunch from one of the food trucks and then boarded the Missouri. We only had to wait a couple of minutes for the next tour group. I highly recommend doing this.  The volunteer tour guide was very knowledgeable and energetic, occasionally apologizing for talking so fast. After some browsing on the deck, and eavesdropping on what other guides said about the signing ceremony, we went below to follow the self-guided tour of the ship. 

We had toured the USS Massachusetts a few weeks earlier, which set different expectations. The self-guided tour on the Missouri is well organized and certainly worth the time, but only goes down one level (or was it two?).  The Massachusetts isn‚Äôt as complete in terms of signage and info, but lets you see much more of the ship, so it takes much longer.  Both ships are worth visiting (if you ever make it to Massachusetts). 

Outside the entrance to the Missouri is the USS Oklahoma Memorial.  This is just the [display of names](https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/visit-the-uss-oklahoma-memorial.htm) shown on the first picture. I suppose just seeing it isn‚Äôt as rewarding as the guided tour with a ranger, but the latter (which visits the Oklahoma and Utah memorials) is just three days a week, once each day.  Still, I took a few minutes to look while waiting for the bus. 

The bus stops at the Aviation Museum next, but we had previously decided not to visit it. After getting back to the main visitor center, we went to the other indoor exhibit, ‚ÄúRoad to War‚Äù and bathrooms.  The snack bar has closed early, and with the water fountain inoperative, we left the Pearl Harbor around 4:30.  It was a full, very rewarding day, and for me emotional - even though neither I nor anyone I know lost people at Pearl Harbor. 

If we ever go back to Honolulu, we probably won‚Äôt visit the Arizona Memorial again, but would consider both the submarine and aviation museums.",VisitingHawaii

Also, he's deathly afraid of water(despite us living by the ocean on the west coast....)
We've done some of the touristy places. Polynesian center, kuloa ranch, byodo temple, waimea falls, monoa, mount tantalus, hanauma bay, punchbowl, flea market, Chinatown, shaka guide. We always take a drive to the north shore and the caves at the very end of the west side. We will also go on a sight seeing cruise in Kauai later on the trip so dont want to do that on Oahu.

I dont do well with the go with the flow lifestyle... I need lists! 
So far, Ive got cat cafe, iolani palace, bishop museum, pearl harbor, zoo, aquarium(they have tropical fish right), botanical gardens.

I like little places like that lavendar farm in Maui. We're not much into hiking... but may do diamond head, pillbox or the lighthouse depending on how hot it gets.

Im not looking for ""hidden gems"" but maybe just lesser known things to do, or funky resturants?

We‚Äôre a couple in our late 20s. Overall, we loved Oahu, liked the Big Island, and thought Maui was just okay. The main focuses of our trip were trying a lot of different foods, which we did and enjoyed most of, and taking in the beautiful nature Hawaii has to offer, which we did and enjoyed nearly all of. We enjoyed Oahu the most because it offered the most of everything and it was easy to get around. Maui got docked a few points mostly because of how much drive time was required to do most things and it definitely wouldn‚Äôt have been worth it if we hadn‚Äôt been able to use credit card points for our hotel. HVNP was the big highlight of the Big Island, and we enjoyed a majority of what we did. If we had the chance, we‚Äôd probably go back to see more of the BI. In general, we were expecting food to be way more expensive than it was (yay for not meeting expectations) but it was surprisingly difficult for us to find fruits to try besides pineapple, mango, and papaya (boo for not meeting expectations).¬†

Overall Rating: 9/10

Day 0: Travel/arrival

* Landed in Honolulu around 7pm after a very long day of traveling. I wanted to get Marugame Udon for dinner but balked at the line. I had heard that the line moves fast, but we were way too tired to wait, so we got Kono‚Äôs instead. My bomber was a bit too salty and greasy, but my boyfriend loved his.

Day 1: Honolulu

* We started the day with Diamond Head. We had the 7-8am reservation, which was perfect, since it was super busy on our way down. üåü
* I wanted to have lunch at Helena‚Äôs but they were unfortunately closed for the duration of the Oahu leg of our trip. Did not learn this until we got there (sign taped to the door), so definitely check their website if this is on your itinerary.
* Walked to Bishop Museum from Helena‚Äôs and walked around and had a very sad lunch at the Highway Inn there. The Bishop Museum was beautiful and there was lots to see and read. Chose to do this over Polynesian Cultural Center due to the PCC controversy with the Church of LDS.
* Saw the Iolani Palace and the King Kamehameha statue. Cool to see both, but we didn‚Äôt do the formal tour at Iolani Palace.
* Had dinner at Tonkatsu Tamafuji. This was hands down one of the best meals we had the entire trip. We weren‚Äôt able to get a reservation so we arrived at 3:30pm to join the waitlist (we were second or third) and were seated almost immediately when they opened for dinner. üíú

Day 2: North Shore

* Started the morning early with the Makapu‚Äôu Point Lighthouse trail. Super easy and got to see the sunrise at the top. We really liked this trail. üåü
* Spent some time at Lanikai Beach and it was a nice beach to relax on
* Headed up to drive through Ho‚Äôomaluhia Botanical Garden and the mountain ranges were stunning. üåü
* Lunch at Da Bald Guy. It was good but nothing mindblowing. I wanted to try Ry‚Äôs Poke too, but they were closed for a few days. Again, learned from a sign on their window lol.
* We did the Ehukai Pillbox Hike and went past the first pillbox to see the second pillbox. The views from there were phenomenal. My poor feet were suffering a little and the downhill stretches were a bit scary at times, but it was worth it. üåü
* We got an acai bowl from Haleiwa Bowls and it was so delicious and refreshing. üåü
* Checked out the North Shore Macadamia Nut Company, North Shore Soap Factoryüåü, and the Waialua Sugar Millüåü. We got some souvenirs for family and even got a little tour at the sugar mill. Pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed these stops.¬†
* Second lunch at Jenny‚Äôs Shrimp Truck. Good, but again, nothing mindblowing.
* Laniakea Beach was super crowded so we went to Papa‚Äôiloa Beach instead. Pretty and not crowded at all, and saw our first sea turtle here!
* We were pretty tired from the early morning so we decided to skip the last couple of things on our itinerary (Sunset Beach and Ted‚Äôs Bakery)

Day 3: Waikiki

* Started the day at KCC Farmers Market. We had mochi from Daizu Tei, banh mi from Pig and the Lady, and passion fruit cane juice (can‚Äôt remember the name of the stand). We also got a cup of a variety of cut fruit, which was pretty subpar and disappointing -- a majority of the fruit tasted unripe. üíú
* Lunch at Ono Seafood. It was good, but if I learned anything on this trip, I don‚Äôt like poke as much as I thought.
* Evening was spent at Kualoa Ranch for a friend‚Äôs wedding. What a beautiful venue!

Day 4: Waikiki

* Hung out on Waikiki Beach for a while before getting lunch at Marugame Udon. Udon was really tasty but I definitely didn‚Äôt need to get the tempura too. Extra points for the great value! üíú
* Wandered around International Marketplace but didn‚Äôt do any shopping
* Quick snack at Musubi Cafe. Good, but also thought that I‚Äôd like spam musubis more.
* Took a nap before getting dinner at Omakase by Aung. This was an amazing and delicious experience. The vibes were \*chef‚Äôs kiss\* üíú

Day 5: Waikiki

* Got coffee and some pastries from Kona Coffee | b patisserie. Coffee was fine but the pastries were to die for. Waited in line for a while, so it‚Äôs probably good to go at a random time in the middle of the day rather than first thing in the morning üåü/üíú
* Headed over to the Pearl Harbor Historic Sites and went to the Battleship Missouri Memorial, Aviation Museum, and USS Arizona. Didn‚Äôt have time for the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum but if we could go back, we‚Äôd do that instead of the Aviation Museum. The Battleship Missouri Memorial was really cool and my WW2 buff boyfriend loved it. üåü
* Wanted to get dinner at Maguro Brother, but was yet again met with a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre closed and will reopen on x date‚Äù sign. Went to Maguro Spot instead.
* We had shave ice at Island Vintage for dessert. We LOVED it and got one that had frozen yogurt in the center. I am dying to have it again. üíú

**Maui**  
Overall Rating: 7/10  
Hotel: Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa (we walked down pretty much the entire 2 mile strip of resorts in Kaanapali and from the outside, I'd say that the Hyatt Regency was among the nicer resorts. However, we would never in a million years stay here if it weren't for CC points)

Day 6: Travel to Maui

* Flew to Maui in the AM and grabbed lunch at Thai Mee Up. Tasty! Unfortunately, we were there pretty early so most of the other trucks were closed. Checked out Costco too, because why not, and had to resist the urge to buy a million snacks.
* Went to the Iao Valley State Monument and did a few short trails there but the star of the day was the Waihe‚Äôe Ridge trail. It was probably the most challenging hike we did our entire trip, but it had the best views. It was unfortunately a bit cloudy at the top, but on the bright side, we didn‚Äôt have the sun beating down on our backs and were able to get pretty amazing views halfway up. üåü
* Checked into our hotel before heading out for dinner at Star Noodle. This was another favorite dinner. It‚Äôs small plates/family style and while our waiter suggested starting with a noodle plate plus 2-3 other plates, we ended up ordering a second round of plates because everything we had was so good. üíú

Day 7: Haleakala

* The sunrise was breathtaking but I never want to do that drive in the dark ever again, even as a passenger. We left at 2:30am and arrived 30 minutes before sunrise and would suggest leaving even earlier to beat the tour buses. It was CROWDED. Did a few trails (Pa Ka‚Äôoao, Leleiwi Overlook, and the first half of Halemau‚Äôu) and headed back to the hotel for a much needed nap lol. üåü
* On the way back, we grabbed a few snacks and poke from Foodland
* Explored Lahaina a little before going to the Old Lahaina Luau. The luau was enjoyable and the amount of food was insane. We didn‚Äôt love the food (our favorites were probably the apps and dessert), so because of that and the fact that we‚Äôre not big drinkers, it was a bit overpriced.

Day 8: Road to Hana

* Not to be all poo-poo about it but both of us thought this was way too overrated. I‚Äôve given my thoughts on some other threads, but there are scenic drives in northern Michigan that are way prettier than the Road to Hana. The only things worth stopping for were Waianapanapa State Park üåü and the Pipiwai trail üåü and maybe the Keanae Arboretum just to look at the rainbow eucalyptus trees up close and the roadside lava tube. Other than that, we were not impressed by the beaches or the waterfalls and it was exhausting. Oh, and unpopular opinion, but Aunty Sandy‚Äôs banana bread is so overrated.
* We had lunch in the middle at Braddah Hutts. It was very tasty but we definitely could‚Äôve shared a plate. Dinner at Tin Roof was on the itinerary but we decided to skip because of how full we were from lunch.

Day 9: Resort Bumming

* Given how exhausting the previous day was, we just bummed by the pool all day and napped.
* We got dinner at Huihui, which exceeded our expectations and we watched the lovely sunset as we ate.

Day 10: Snorkeling

* We did a half-day snorkel tour with Sea Maui and it was a really great experience! We went to two spots and had breakfast, lunch, and drinks included. üíú
* Took a much needed nap before going to Down the Hatch for dinner. We weren‚Äôt super hungry so we just shared an appetizer and entree and got shave ice at Ululani‚Äôs afterwards. Both were good but we liked the Island Vintage shave ice better than Ululani‚Äôs.

Overall Rating: 8/10  
Hotel: Orchid Tree B&B (I wanted to gatekeep this but it was too cute of a B&B to not share. The suite we got was clean and comfortable and the simple breakfast in the morning was great. The host cut fresh fruit from their yard for us) üíú

Day 11: Travel/HVNP

* Traveled to the Big Island early in the morning. We stopped by Greenwell Farms for coffee beans to take home, but didn‚Äôt have time for a free tour. The beans were a bit pricey but oh well, it‚Äôs a souvenir for family and it was 100% Kona coffee.
* We did a farm tour at Kuaiwi Farm and it was fun! We had a bit of a weird group but the owners were great and gave samples of a variety of things to try. üåü
* Lunch at Shaka Tacoz was delicious. I was in dire need of some vegetables, so I ordered a salad and it was HUGE. I‚Äôve never had such a filling salad.
* We were going to check out the green sand beach but decided against it and headed to HVNP instead. We were able to fit in the Devastation Trail, steam vents, sulphur banks, Kilauea Overlook, and the Thurston Lava Tube. This really freed up our second day at the park and everything was very cool. üåü
* We got ramen at Tetsumen in Hilo for dinner and it was a pleasant surprise! It was a great way to end the cold and rainy day. üåü

Day 12: HVNP/Travel

* Since we had time for HVNP the previous day, we only did the Kilauea Iki trail which was also really cool. We were impressed and amazed by HVNP. üåü
* We went back to Hilo to check out the farmers market and this was possibly the most disappointing part of our short visit to the BI. Despite being warned during the farm tour the day prior, I wanted to try white pineapple before leaving and was convinced by the vendor that I purchased from that the pineapples were ripe. We had been warned during the farm tour that many vendors at farmers markets will lie and sell unripe fruit. So I ended up spending over $20 on an unripe white pineapple that made my tongue burn. I made myself eat probably 1/3 of it before I gave up and threw it out. I also purchased a mountain apple that was also definitely not ripe and I couldn‚Äôt eat more than the one bite I took. Lesson learned, I suppose.
* We stopped by Rainbow Falls (had time to kill) and it was alright.
* We had a late lunch at Cafe 100 and Ken‚Äôs House of Pancakes (also alright) before our long trip home.",VisitingHawaii

**Itinerary:** 

Day 1: Arrived at KOA in the afternoon, relaxed at hotel and had dinner in Waimea 

Day 2: North Coast driving tour (loosely followed the highlights of Shaka guide tour): Waipio Valley lookout, Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens, Hilo Waterfalls, Kaumana Caves, Mauna Kea

* Kaumana Caves was one of my favorite parts of the trip (bring a flashlight!) and much cooler than doing the lava tube at Volcanoes Park
* I wish we had budgeted more time to explore around Mauna Kea (and around Saddle Road) besides just doing the visitor center. Such a crazy physical environment up there!
* While pretty and has some cool views, the Botanical Garden was a disappointment.. why does it have hardly any native Hawaiian plants?

Day 3: Polulu Valley hike, hiked near Waimea, relaxed/snorkeled at hotel beach

Day 6: Got up early to head to Volcanoes National Park and hit Punaluu black sand beach on the way.

* Arrived at Volcanoes around noon and hit most of the highlights rest of day: Chain of Craters Road Driving Tour, Steam Bluffs, Thurston Lava Tube, Puu Loa Petroglyphs, Mauna Ulu Eruption Trail (didn't see this one mentioned much but was maybe my favorite), Sea Arch 

Day 7: Stayed at Volcanoes Lodge prior night and finished our time with Kilauea Iki Trail and Devastation trail before having to head to Hilo to go to Kauai.

1683253082.0,Beautiful Big Island + OK Oahu,"TLDR: the Big Island is phenomenal and I cannot wait to go back!! Oahu has some nice scenic pockets but majority is busy/crowded and Waikiki reminded me of Miami South Beach. I would not return to Oahu.

I am from Atlanta and have lived in Toronto and NYC for background.
Total cost for two: $7,000 USD 

Day 1 - Kona
Lodging: Courtyard Marriott King Kamehameha, clean rooms and nice ocean view 

Car: Jeep

Food: 
Kau Coffee Mill Coffee Shop - has the best coffee IMO, it was so good! 

Pa‚Äôakai Poke & Deli - not bad for first poke place nice people, fresh fish 

L&L Hawaiian BBQ - many trips here for a fast meal!

Cheeky Tiki - well decorated lounge

Kona Brewing Co - great beer, bad food lol

Broke Da Mouth Grindz - the best value and tastiest plate place in my opinion

Activity: we snorkeled at the little cove at the Marriott and there was so much to see if you can swim farther out behind the house!

Ululani Shave Ice - the best!!

Day 2-3 - Captain Cook

Lodging: Belle Vue Kona B&B - A MUST STAY!!! Email/Call Viviane immediately she has a 4 acre lush garden property with the best views ever overlooking the Pacific Ocean 

Activity: HVNP the Thurston Lava Tubes are very short so we ended up doing the crater rim trail which was insanely tiring but so fulfilling when you finish it.
Night Manta Ray Snorkel - so worth it! It‚Äôs magical! We went with Hawaii Island & Ocean Tours! 

Food:
The Coffee Shack - ok food, much better ambiance and views. Gets really busy tho so come early.

Kaya‚Äôs Kawanui Inc - my partners favorite mocha of the trip, delicious treats!

Punalu‚Äôu Bakeshop - incredible likikoi masalada

Hana Hou - food is ok but worst service ever and took 1 hour for food to come

ChoiceMART - bougie grocery store with good sandwiches 


Day 3-7 - Waikoloa 
Lodging: Mauna Lani Point (holy shit was this the fanciest condo I ever stayed in‚Ä¶.!!) I booked using Hyatt points+cash so I had no idea! I highly recommend staying here for the private beach club! We spent most of our free time snorkeling there!

Activity: Mauna Kea Summit - we went with Hawaii Forest & Trail and loved our fancy bus, thermos dinner, and tour guide! So weird to see snow caps in Hawaii!

Food:
Foodland - had everything we needed and more 

Island Gourmet - ABC store company with good hot and cold foods

Fosters Kitchen Waikoloa - got takeout here and it was tasty but the portions were for kids or something!!

Day 8 - Hilo
Activity: Akaka Falls Quick easy hike to the fall and beautiful drive there 

Food: poke market llc probably the best poke I ever had and from a small takeout window! They have to go parking only 

Day 9-15- Oahu
Lodging: Waikiki Beach Marriott - $50 valet was super efficient and worth it. $50 resort fee unavoidable in Waikiki and no benefit. Two ABC stores and two Starbucks were nice though in the hotel!

Activity: do the e-bike tour at Kualoa Ranch it was the highlight of the island for me! You will get muddy!

Stoke Drift surf school - there‚Äôs a reason why they have 5 star google reviews, the best experience and coolest instructors!

Hanauma Bay - not worth it to me the water is too shallow for coral and so hard to swim in. I found the beach club at Mauna Lani way better.

I think the island of Oahu is just too busy for me that it didn‚Äôt feel like a vacation anymore! There‚Äôs a lot more food options, a Chinatown is really cool, but overall it‚Äôs not where I would vacation again.

1671405240.0,Recently visited Honolulu for my birthday and ate at 25 places in 6 days! (Dec. 7th-13th),"I had an absolute blast in my visit! I made sure to tip well and to be respectful to the locals, because after all, it isn't some playground for tourists, people have to make a living here too.

I did an activity each day:

* Day 1: Explored Wakiki Beach, Pearl Harbor Parade
* Day 2: Diamond Head hike
* Day 3: Honolulu Zoo
* Day 4: Went on a catamaran, explored Waimanalo Beach
* Day 5: Saw Iolani Place, King Kamehameha statue, explored Chinatown a bit, hit up Sandy Beach Park
* Day 6: Visited the Pearl Harbor Parade

Between all this, I ate 25 places in 6 days and even snuck in three workouts! Hahaha. I think I did a great job of balancing traditional Hawaii cuisines (such as saimin, squid lu'au, kalua pork, garlic shrimp, etc.) and other cool spots such as Sunset Texas BBQ (which has amazing brisket).

I can't wait to piece all of my videos together! I had an amazing time and appreciated all the beauty of the island.

1651501103.0,8 days on the big island - a summary of our trip - part 1,"I‚Äôll start by saying there would‚Äôve never been enough time to do everything I wanted to do on the big island. What an amazing place Hawaii is and I would love to go back some day! That said, I wish we had made our trip two days longer. I think 10 days on the island would‚Äôve made me feel happier but we couldn‚Äôt get the time off work and the travel is long so we did what we could.  Here are my thoughts on the things we did, the unique experiences, and the amazing ness of it all. 

We landed a little later than planned and I have to say getting our rental car took forever. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just the place we used (dollar rental) or all the rental places, but the wait was long. We waited for the shuttle, we waited for the check in, then we waited for the car. My husband definitely got frustrated but in the end, it was worth the wait. 

Once those logistics were settled, we headed to our first hotel - the Hilton waikoloa resort. I was relieved I had done some research beforehand because the island gourmet grocery store was still open at that time and we were able to grab some premade sandwiches and chips so we had something to eat. 

I kind of knew what we were getting into with the Hilton so I wasn‚Äôt disappointed but I definitely do not recommend it to people visiting the big island. Maybe it‚Äôs good for families, but a fake beach and imprisoned dolphins are not hawaii at all. We booked it because we knew we‚Äôd want an easy pool to sit by for our time change adjustment day. It did work for that, and the weather in waikoloa is perfect, but it‚Äôs a big no for me going forward. I‚Äôm glad our time there was short. 

Then we headed over to Hilo. We used the Shaka tour north island jungle tour and had an amazing day on our drive over. It didn‚Äôt take nearly as long as I thought it would even with the stops at the garden and akaka falls. I really felt like we saw so much! Malasadas at big Tex were definitely not overhyped and a must do, and I‚Äôll never forget the view from the Waipi‚Äôo valley lookout. 

When we arrived in Hilo we saw a crowded beach and decided to get in and swim. To our absolute delight there were three huge turtles swimming there as well!! An absolutely amazing spontaneous hawaii experience I will remember for the rest of my life. This happened at Keaukaha beach park and it was also a ray moment of sunshine in Hilo and is probably my favorite memory of our trip. 

The next day we headed down to volcano! We once again used the Shaka guide and hands down the tour was amazing. If you do use it be sure to know where the lava is flowing because the tour is not updated with that information. But again this was just such a unique experience and standing on land that was formed after I had graduated college was mind blowing. The hike out to the petroglyphs was hot and sunny but totally worth it - bring a hat for that it helped a lot. We headed back to Hilo for the night, and had a long day the next day so we knew we‚Äôd need our rest! 

The following day we turned on our friendly Shaka guide again for the South Island tour taking us to Kona. We didn‚Äôt love this tour as much, but I am glad we did it. The black sand beach was a gorgeous site to see and we stopped for lunch before heading to south point and the green sand beach. I have *a lot* of thoughts on the green sand beach and wish we had skipped it because it was honestly not that impressive. There are only four in the world so the appeal is definitely there to make you feel like you MUST go, but I really think it looks just like pictures. I definitely saw a lot of people struggling on the hike over who definitely didn‚Äôt have enough water or weren‚Äôt in good enough shape for it. It was a scary situation, honestly. If you are not prepared, and morally opposed to paying the locals for the truck ride, just skip it. I promise it isn‚Äôt the most amazing thing you‚Äôll see!

1665241316.0,Kauai October trip review,"After much help from this wonderful subreddit, my family of two boys 5 and 3, my wife, and I went to Kauai during the first week of October. Just wanted to share my trip to help others as they‚Äôve helped me.  
  
**Day 1:** We arrived around noon and went immediately to baggage claim to pick up our luggage and two car seats. I hate those things. Rented a car from Alamo - no line- and drove straight to Lawai market, which we found to be rather unimpressive. A little let down since so many people recommended it. We had their boxed lunches as they were out of most things and bought a few fruits and pastries for the kids. We then checked in at Koloa Landing Resort, which is a really beautiful resort with great hospitality and a pretty fun pool. They were apparently voted #1 pool in America so‚Ä¶ I guess? It had two water slides, a water fall grotto, infinity pool, adults only pool, and smaller kids pools. We went to the pools everyday.   
  
Dinner was at Merrimen‚Äôs and, while it was our most expensive dinner, it was fantastic. 8.5/10. Amazing view during sunset with great service. Nice wine to start. Mac nut crusted swordfish with herb rice and scallops/shrimps with garlic noods for parents. Quesadillas and fries for kids. Not surprisingly after the long day and time zone difference, the boys passed out during dinner and we finished our meals and complimentary desert with them sleeping on us.  
  
**Day 2:** We had a small brekkie in our 1 bedroom villa the whole week with an assortment of pastries and fruits we picked up locally and at the resort marketplace. Wish we got at least a partial ocean front view, though. Our view from the lanai was no bueno. Lunch was at Keoki‚Äôs Paradise and the food was barely average. Fish tacos and Korean fried chicken for us and teriyaki chicken and fries for the boys. Very slow service despite empty restaurant, and unimpressive food. Average: 5/10.  
  
Spent the day at the pool but called it early due to needing to get ready for a family photoshoot at Shipwreck beach during sunset. Worst experience of my life as I got swarmed by beach nats the entire time. Only me! Photos turned out nice though. Dinner was supposed to be at Bubba‚Äôs Burger but due to my poor planning (closed on Mondays), we opted for Bangkok Happy Bowl Thai Bistro and Sushi Bar. The worst meal of our trip. 2/10. I would never eat or recommend that place to anyone who‚Äôs ever had Thai. You‚Äôre better off going to sleep without dinner. Kids enjoyed Lappert‚Äôs ice cream while we waited. I suppose this was the only ‚Äúbad‚Äù day of our trip lol.  
  
**Day 3:** We headed out around 9 am for Waimea Canyon lookout. Easy drive and a wonderful site. It‚Äôs very obvious why they call it the Grand Canyon of the pacific. After a short stay, we headed back and got to Bubba‚Äôs for early lunch. The cashier was unfriendly, but the food was really good. Teriyaki burg for the wife and regular and double burgs for the kids and me. Chili fries were great too. Water downed drinks, however. 7/10.  
  
We checked out Poipu beach and boy was it crowded. It was still a lot of fun and we got to see a bunch of fish and turtles. The water is calm enough for younger kids but not nearly as clear as I remember some other Hawaiian waters to be. We had Waikomo shave ice on the way back to the pool - good shave ice! 6.5/10. Dinner was at the Dolphin Poipu. 7/10. Good temaki and maki. My wife liked the poke bowl and chowder. Kids shared the keiki ahi meal.  
  
**Day 4:** Had brunch at Kalaheo Cafe which was a great place. Not a long wait either. 7/10 for their typical American brekkie meals. Tried out Baby Beach, which we didn‚Äôt really like as the waters were rather rough, even if quite clear, and the beach declined steeply. Even the little enclosed area with the rocks was rough. Not worth it unless there‚Äôs low tide and the parking was limited. Back to the pool for more water slide fun.  
  
Dinner was at Duke‚Äôs Kauai. 9/10 for the food and views. Probably our favorite dinner as we were seated right at the edge with spectacular views. Great service and food. Crab wontons were fantastic, wine was good, and my ribs and chicken plate was delicious. Not my favorite ribs but the huli chicken was amazing. Wife really liked her seafood curry as well and kids enjoyed their Mac and cheese and fruits. They also gave us a hula pie on the house for my birthday. Delish. Free valet parking too! We found a small ABC store finally nearby and grabbed some Kauai tshirts.  
  
**Day 5:** We went back to Kalaheo Cafe for their brunch. Wife tried out their loco moco and I got a spam, egg, and rice plate, which is basically what I eat back home but it somehow tasted better lol. Decent pancakes for the kids but they enjoyed their fruits again. We stopped by Uncle‚Äôs shave ice and I thought it was ok. 5.5/10.  
  
Back to Poipu beach! Lots of fun but the kids wanted to go back to the water slide at the resort pool. But before we headed back, we stopped by Puka Dogs for a few hot dogs and lemonade. 6/10? I don‚Äôt know if they f‚Äôd up our order but both the grownups‚Äô dogs were not spicy at all even though we ordered jalape√±o spicy and there‚Äôs just way too much bread to dog ratio. The toppings were nice and the lemonade was delicious however. I really don‚Äôt get the hype behind this joint but glad we tried it but it was just decent. The kids really enjoyed them though.  
  
Dinner was again at Bubba‚Äôs so I could try their double teriyaki burg. It‚Äôs better than the original, I think. Watered down drinks again. Something‚Äôs wrong with their fountain drink mix ratio.  
  
The resort offered free s‚Äômores night and the kids had fun with that. Great resort.  
  
**Day 6:** Time to fly back home. We decided to go with Daddy O‚Äôs for their oxtail soup over Tip Top Cafe. We went way early expecting a line but got seated right away. Their American brekkie was good, especially their pancakes, but their oxtail soup was BOMB. 7.5/10. Wish we tried out Tip Top‚Äôs oxtail soup. We tried out some local pastries at the bakery next door (ensamada and puto were tasty) too before we left over the airport.  
  
As you can tell, with two young kids, our adventure/excursion options were limited.  But still, we really had an amazing time. The resort was top notch and having a washer and dryer along with a full kitchen in the villa was so convenient. Thanks to this subreddit for helping me plan the trip allowing my family and I to have a wonderful birthday week. The locals were very friendly and we‚Äôre going to miss this island - the final island of our yearly Hawaii trips. We‚Äôll be back once the kids are older and we can do some open door helicopter trips and Na Pali coast boat rides. Mahalo!",VisitingHawaii
1661410010.0,August 2022 - Kauai Trip report,"Our family of 4 (parents, 2 boys (10, 8 years old) enjoyed our [Kauai](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html) vacation right before their school year started. Please see below on details for our trip and please ask any questions!

Day 1

The [flight](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) was uneventful and about 5.5 hrs and we landed at around 11:30am and I noted that [Lihue](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60623-Lihue_Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html) Airport is really small, consisting of 10 total gates. Getting the bags was quick and efficient, honestly, somewhat contrary to what we‚Äôll see is [Hawaii](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g28932-Hawaii-Vacations.html) time! The [rental car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii.html) shuttle for Avis/Budget had an extremely long line and it took us to the 3rd bus to make it but finally we got our [rental car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii.html) and vacation started!

We were staying at the Grand Hyatt and so began to make our way [Koloa](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60621-Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html) where we planned to stop for lunch on the way to the hotel and to kill a little time since check in was at 4PM. We decided to get poke at [Koloa Fish Market](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60621-d495097-Reviews-Koloa_Fish_Market-Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii.html) for the adults and Sueoka‚Äôs Store for the boys. Koloa was not a problem but when I went to order Sueoka‚Äôs for some plate lunches, I was told it was a minimum of 30 minutes. Now 30 minutes may not seem like a lot unless you‚Äôve got hungry kids and so it might as well have been 3 hours! So we deviated and ended up driving to get them food from Keoki‚Äôs Paradise. If we decided to eat at Keoki‚Äôs, it definitely had nice d√©cor and a laid back feel but we decided to get it to go and head to the hotel to eat out lunch.

We got to the hotel prior to our check in but fortunately they provided us access to the Grand Club plus gave us 4 drink vouchers to use at the pool while we waited for our room. We wandered to the Club and it was fairly spacious and we were finally able to relax and eat our first meal in Kauai!

We did end up getting into the room about 30-45 minutes prior to the official check in time which was nice and we were able to change in more appropriate Kauai attire so we could head to the farmer‚Äôs market at the Kaua‚ÄôI Culinary Market which was only held on Wednesday afternoons. It was nice to walk around and see what there was for sale but our goal was to go because we had read that this was the only place we could get Monkeypod Jam, which was one of the things we heard was fairly unique in Kauai. Even though I was pretty full, I also stopped at the Right Slice table and got 2 slices of pie ‚Äì Mango Lilikoi and Macadamia Nut.

We headed back to the hotel and there was enough time and daylight to hit one of the many pool at the Hyatt. Throughout the trip, there are so many pools and close beach access that it never seemed overly crowded but we also noticed that around 4 ‚Äì 4:30, people started to leave the pool. This ended up being perfect for the boys as the slide closed at 6 and they basically went non-stop on the slide for a good 45 minutes.

By this time, due to jetlag, it was nearly 8PM US West Coast time so we went back to the hotel and grabbed a light meal at the Grand Club (this will be a recurring theme) and went to the room to relax and ultimately get some much needed rest!

Day 2

Luckily, our family is typically early risers so that, plus a bit of jet lag, had us up early which was great because we were trying to leave early to hit a few stops prior to our scheduled helicopter tour. Breakfast was at the Grand Club and we got in our [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii.html) and heading out at about 8am. First stop, even though we just ate, was Ko Bakery as I heard the Banana Bread was great there. It is a nice little store with very friendly employees but ultimately we felt it was basically a really nice coffee shop. Our next stop however, was one of my wife‚Äôs favorites and that was Kauai Bakery, where we purchased 3 malasadas: Ube, Guava, and cream.

We took our goodies and headed for a couple of quick waterfall views. We had decided not to do any hiking on this trip so we were looking for views that we could see from the road. With that in mind, we hit up the lookouts for Wailua and [Opaekaa Falls](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29218-d108540-Reviews-Opaekaa_Falls-Kauai_Hawaii.html).

Parking for Wailua was limited to about 10 spots so I would advise getting there earlier, particularly if you want to hike down there. [Wailua Falls](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60623-d546344-Reviews-Wailua_Falls-Lihue_Kauai_Hawaii.html) was pretty spectacular but I could see that hiking down to the pool would have been worthwhile. Opaekaa Falls has a much larger parking lot but the falls were also MUCH farther away. Each view probably only need about 10 minutes.

We headed for our helicopter tour with Blue Hawaiian. Because our kids were not old enough, we did not book the open door helicopter and the configuration of the helicopter was 4 seats in the back and 2 in the front. When we booked, we decided to pay extra to upgrade 2 of our 4 seats to a guaranteed front row. The day before, we received a call from Blue Hawaiian basically saying that our guaranteed seats were unavailable and we would get a refund. The explanation that I received was that someone had booked the seats a few days before us so they had to honor that reservation. My main annoyance was how could we have booked a couple of months ago and we only found out the day before our tour? It was also too late to change to a different day (relevant for another tour we booked) so we just had to go with it. Ultimately, we still had a blast and even one of my boys, who said he didn‚Äôt like helicopters prior to the tour, grudgingly admitted he had a great time. One highlight for my wife was, as a huge BTS fan, she was able to happily chat with Ashley about BTS while Ashley was assisting in seating her in the helicopter. And then on top of that, Greg, who was our pilot, apparently also had a fair amount of knowledge of BTS and referenced the ARMY. Greg was a great pilot, who was hilarious and provided some interesting facts during the tour.

Feet back on the ground and we were hungry (surprise! But we really try to eat as many of the local places as possible when we go on vacation). Originally the plan was to get Hamura Saimin to go and grab Mark‚Äôs Place and find a place to eat. However, we read that Mark‚Äôs Place is likely to have a similar wait as Sueoko‚Äôs so we decided to postpone Mark‚Äôs (big mistake) and just eat at Hamura.

Hamura is a nice local Saimin restaurant run by 3 auntie‚Äôs. The menu is fairly basic and simple but that is more than ok when the food is wonderful. We ended up getting a Sumo bowl, which we ended up sharing between the parents and one son and got our other son his own bowl. We also got a few chicken skewers which were promptly devoured. I felt that the food was really done well because even though it is pretty warm, with no A/C, I‚Äôm still happily slurping up the noodles and drinking the soup. We enjoyed it so much, we stopped by one more time before the end of the vacation.

Our stomachs full once again, we moved on and headed to Lydgate Farms for chocolate tasting based on a recommendation of a family friend who had recently visited. The chocolate was very tasty and the two ladies provided samples and historical context were extremely friendly. One note of caution ‚Äì we passed by one of the local schools on the way up and didn‚Äôt think much of it but there was a major traffic jam around 2:30 as all the parents were picking up their kids! Just something to note if you‚Äôre there during the school year.

We started to make our way back to the hotel with more planned stops along the way. Among them was one of the two ABC stores on Kauai. We‚Äôve been to [Oahu](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g29222-Oahu_Hawaii-Vacations.html) many times and my wife was surprised that ABC wasn‚Äôt all over. This ABC store was convenient because let‚Äôs be honest, we were there for the Wailua Shave Ice! We ended up getting a Lava Flow, which is Fresh Pineapple Juice, Haupia Foam, plus strawberries and pineapple on top. Absolutely delicious and a welcome treat in the warm weather.

Our last stop on the way back to the hotel was.. [COSTCO](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60623-d12112918-Reviews-Costco-Lihue_Kauai_Hawaii.html). It was interesting to see some of the more unique things there and we ended up getting some sushi for dinner plus some snacks and gifts for friends and family back home.

And with that, our with that, our first full day came to an end (can you believe I‚Äôve talked so much for 36 hours in Kauai?)

Day 3

Our original plan was to go to Po‚Äôipu Beach and then do a ziplining tour with [Koloa Zipline](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60621-d3633205-Reviews-Koloa_Zipline-Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii.html) but once again, Hawaii time struck again. Two days before we left, we received an email saying that our tour had been cancelled and they would refund. It was slightly annoying that we didn‚Äôt get any information beyond that and naturally, being only a few days away, there was absolutely nothing that was available for four. We tried looking at all the other ziplines, kayak tours, etc. I did end up calling and supposedly there were not enough guides to work so they had to cancel some tours. I do find it extremely inconvenient especially when tours are booked months out and finding a replacement is impossible. Plus the fact that.. they didn‚Äôt even say sorry once! But you just have to adjust, after all, we‚Äôre on vacation! Ok, rant over.

We ended up shifting our plans for another day to Friday and so we got in the [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii.html) and headed West to see Waimei Canyon. One note, the distances aren‚Äôt very far from place to place but you basically can‚Äôt drive faster than 35 mph in most places. Being from California, it was quite the adjustment especially since most roads are also one lane each way. You get some really fantastic views and I would encourage to go early. We went to the further point, Pu‚Äôu o Kila lookout and made our way back to [Kalalau Lookout](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29218-d219643-Reviews-Kalalau_Lookout-Kauai_Hawaii.html) and then Waimea Canyon Lookout and it started to get progressively more crowded. In addition, I had read somewhere to try to go early because it would either start getting foggy (reducing the views) or start to rain, which it ended up doing around noon.

Fortunately, because we started early, we were able to grab a quick lunch at [Ishihara Market](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60627-d647272-Reviews-Ishihara_Market-Waimea_Kauai_Hawaii.html) which is a supermarket that has tons of poke, pre made lunch boxes, as well as lunch boxes to order. The menu changes daily so we ended up getting the Pork cutlet lunch, the kalua pork lunch, plus some poke and ate at the tables outside. And then, we went off schedule because I didn‚Äôt realize Jojo‚Äôs Shave Ice was a 5 minute walk away and so we wandered in and ordered a Local‚Äôs North Shore. Jojo‚Äôs is supposed to be known because they make their own syrup and there is macadamia nut ice cream at the bottom. We ordered the Big Kahuna which ended up being as large as our son‚Äôs head and I will have to say that I feel that is the best shave ice I have ever eaten.

On our way back, we ended up stopping at the Salty Wahine, Kauai Coffee, Kauai Kookie, and Right Slice stores to get more local flavors to take home. Well, except for the pie at Right Slice ‚Äì that ended up in my stomach.

That evening, we had reservations at the [Beach House Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60625-d447643-Reviews-Beach_House_Restaurant-Poipu_Koloa_Kauai_Hawaii.html) as we were looking for somewhere with a great sunset view. The location and the view did not disappoint. Neither did the service, which was excellent. The food however, did not seem any better than the local places we had been eating at for a quarter of the price.

Day 4

Saturday was our plan to head up to the North Shore and then make our way back for our Mountain Tubing adventure in the afternoon. As mentioned above, it‚Äôs not that far in actual miles but you can‚Äôt drive overly fast. But you know, just enjoy the views and the drive.

Our first stop was the Foodland [Princeville](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60626-Princeville_Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html) where we grabbed some more local items, such as Uncle Mikey‚Äôs Dried Fruit and Anahola Granola, plus some poke.

Right next to the Foodland were 2 lookouts, [Hanalei](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g60612-Hanalei_Kauai_Hawaii-Vacations.html) Valley and [Hanalei Bay](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29218-d647555-Reviews-Hanalei_Bay-Kauai_Hawaii.html), which were nice views but something that only required 5 minutes max at each stop. We then headed to Hanalei and encountered the small bridge in which only one way traffic was allowed. Getting through that, we arrived at Hanalei and headed towards the pier as I wanted to jump off the pier and into the ocean. Again, it pays to get there early as nearly all the spots were taken. One note, for safety, I believe the morning was low tide because it did not seem too deep. In the more shallow parts, it was about 4 ft and topped off about 5 ft in other areas. My youngest son was a trooper and jumped in once by himself and once with me before declaring that he was terrified about the 20 ft drop (probably 10 ft). So we cleaned up a bit and headed to Hanalei to grab lunch and head back for our tubing.

Hanalei is a small surfer town so once you find parking, you can pretty much walk everywhere within a few minutes and so we had plans to get taro donuts at Honey Grail, Kalua grilled cheese at Pink‚Äôs, and a Poke Bowl at Hanalei Poke.

The first two did not disappoint as we tried the Miso Honey and Haole donuts. Note that this is not simple a donut shop where you just order and go. It‚Äôs a food truck in which everything is made to order and the donuts take a few minutes and come out piping hot. Next stop was Pink‚Äôs and again, everything is made to order and they basically only take one order at a time. Although they are known for their Ice Cream, we were there for the Hawaiian Grilled Cheese, which was a grilled cheese with Kalua Pork and Pineapple. It was excellent.

And so the last shop was one I was excited for as I really enjoy poke and Hanalei Poke is supposed to be one of the best. We get there at 11:25, right before they open at 11:30. However, it looks pretty empty. I go to the door and I‚Äôm crushed. There‚Äôs a handwritten sign that simply says, CLOSED SATURDAYS. I was telling my wife and there was a local loading up a pickup in front of the store and they mentioned it is difficult to find people to work Saturdays which is why they are closed.

So we leave Hanalei without our poke and head back to do our tubing adventure. We checked in, signed our waivers, got our helmets with flashlights and gloves and got into the truck to transport us to the plantation for our adventure. Along the way, our guide, Kyla, provided us with the background of how the tour came into business as well as general Kauai knowledge. She also engaged us in some games to break the ice. We made a stop to take pictures at a lookout for Mt Wai‚Äôale‚Äôale and then hit our tubing adventure. One note, c and f words are strictly prohibited and if the guides hear you say cold or freezing, you get splashed for the first offense and flipped over on the second. We were all very careful to say how REFRESHING the water was. Joining Kyla were two sisters, Ashley and Jessica and all 3 of them made the tubing enjoyable. This wasn‚Äôt a lazy river, as there was a decent flow to it. It was particular interesting going through the tunnel systems, a couple of which were quite long and if you didn‚Äôt turn on the flashlights on your helmet, it was pitch black. Afterwards, there was a picnic lunch which was very simple but you are surprisingly famished and so it hit the spot.

We headed back to the hotel and decided to eat dinner at the hotel at the Seaview Terrace. Every evening there is live music as well so it was a very nice, relaxing meal with some good music.

Day 5/6

That pretty much wraps up our trip as we spent all day Sunday at the hotel enjoying the pool and the beach and then leaving on Monday.

Feel free to ask any questions!

1659214499.0,Appreciation post for Locals kindness,"Just an appreciation post for the instances of casual kindness we experienced on a recent trip to Oahu.

My mom and I have visited Oahu frequently before the pandemic. We just took our first trip back recently. This time, she was more verbal as to why she felt so at home with the kind and tight-knit community. She is adopted from Asia with an Asian-American West-coast upbringing. While not yet locating her birth family, she has visited her home country many times to visit the city and meet up with other adoptees. 

Yet during this past trip, she came to terms with her feelings that the Hawaiian locals (not sure if they were natives) were ""her people."" Of course, she doesn't have hard evidence like DNA tracking or familial ties, but she connected with their openness to strangers, athleticism, easygoingness, and multilingual habits.  Now I thought this could be problematic at first, knowing how easy it can be for a tourist to identify with a destination during a vacation. 

But I'm happy she found a connection (even without much grounds) to people that look and act like her, and that those people were reciprocative and tied to a physical location. It should be noted that she never identified with her country of origin or the people from there as she did not share their traditions, morals, worldviews, nor mannerisms--but more importantly, that she did not connect with that community despite many attempts.

Small examples during our trips that she pointed out and meant a lot:

A construction worker stopping his work to wave at her. Multiple waitresses from other tables casually talking with her. Free food and drinks when my mom couldn't decide between two options. Locals referring her to their family members' businesses, walking with her to show her directions.

...Again this could be just hospitality to the area or that my mom is older (though visually very physically able). But she is thankful nonetheless! I'll always think she'll remember her time in Hawaii as part of her adoptee identity story.",VisitingHawaii

Checked the moon phase and it's waxing gibbous right now, full moon expected on the 28th. Has anyone been up to Mauna Kea to stargaze when the moon is that bright? Looking to see if it's even worth it to spend that much money if the stars won't be that visible.

1664677671.0,Trip Report - early 30's couple Pt 1,"Was very fortunate to take a two-year-delayed honeymoon to Hawaii that I just returned from earlier today. We spent ~10 days between the Big Island and Maui. Please forgive my verbosity--former English teacher!

**Day 1: Travel and Settle in at Big Island**

* Arrived in Kona ~1:30pm
* Stayed at a quaint Vrbo right outside Kona for the entirety of our time on this island. 
* Foster's Kitchen for early dinner, which both wife and I loved (a great light fish and chips) **8/10**
* Stopped by Snorkel Bob's, a grocery store, and finished the night with the Maka'eo walking path. It's the former airport which has been converted into a park. Along a rocky beach, but the nature path was a nice easy thing to do near the water that was pretty quiet.

**Day 2: Overzealous Exertions**

* Jet lag aided us in waking up bright and early to tackle Captain Cook. The trailhead is unremarkable, wedged between two private properties. We started before dawn and were already second-guessing ourselves at a mile in. First mile or so is pretty dense underbrush on either side. Towards the end it opens up to see the coast and lose tree cover (although we were early enough that the sun wasn't an issue). The terrain was challenging the whole way--which was a great introduction to the fact that this is a volcanic island (very rocky!). The main hurdle though was the mental one of knowing every step you took would be replicated (and harder) on the way uphill in the heat of the day. At 1.5 miles down we sat and very nearly turned around. A solo girl hiker and a very unprepared couple passed us in the meantime, convincing my wife that we could do it, so we finished it out. 
* Cap'n Cook Snorkel: Saw goats near the bottom and were among the first to the snorkel spot (one kayak group was there with a helpful tour guide even giving advice to us (foolish?) hikers! That unprepared couple started asking folks for water at the bottom, as they thought there was some other way out of Captain Cook. We had been worried about our phone/valuables, but it was so remote and so few people that it was fine to leave in our packs on dry land. The snorkeling itself was great! A highlight of the trip for me, although my first ever snorkel experience, so very little standard of comparison. After 30-45 minutes in the water we got out, ate some granola bars, and started heading back up with frequent stops in the shade. My wife termed this hike as a ""physical, mental, and emotional journey"". **10/10** would not hike again and would just take a kayak or boat tour (or just gone to Two Step). But it made for a good shared experience! (in all seriousness, I'd rate the snorkel **9/10**)
* Kaaloa's Super J's: Very local spot for laulau and authentic Hawaiian food. I really enjoyed the laulau, the meat was a little fatty for my wife. **7/10**
* Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park: Great chance to explore some Hawaii history. We were still pretty beat from our hike, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Get in free with a U.S. Nat'l Parks pass. **7/10**
* At this point we'd been gone half the day, exhausted by the hike, and my wife had been such a trooper. I cut out some things, we relaxed at the lodging and went back to Foster's Kitchen because she had liked it a lot.
* Manta Ray snorkel experience in the evening! Booked through Sea Paradise and they were great. Solid boat, refreshments on board, great crew, gave us wetsuits, etc. The experience itself was wonderful. Having those gentle giants so close was mesmerizing and made me value our fragile ecosystems all the more. I will admit that after 15-20 minutes of watching, I was feeling a touch seasick and my wife was cold. So we headed back to the boat for hot chocolate. **8.5/10**

**Day 3: Volcanoes Nat'l Park**

* If the Capt Cook hike was mistake #1, trying to fit in the Nat'l Park while staying in Kona was mistake #2. It made for too long a day and--like the hike--the prospect of the trip back soured the time at the destination itself.
* Left early; stopped at Hawaiian Style Cafe in Hilo for breakfast. Really enjoyed the vibe and the food! **8/10**
* Stopped by the visitor's center.
* Did the Thurston Lava Tube (much cooler if you get there early and can experience it in near solitude!) **7/10**
* Hiked reverse down Kilauea Iki trail to the crater. We were feeling Capt Cook still, and turned around at that point. **6/10**
* Chain of Craters Road: At this point I had been driving for...4 hours? So we skipped Devastation trail, and basically rushed through the road. The arch at the end was a major let down. The park ranger said it wasn't to be missed since a crack has developed in it, but the time and drive to get there and the formation itself were very underwhelming. **3/10**
* My wife took the drive back to Kona; stopped in Hilo at Kula Shave Ice which was just perfect. My first time having ice cream combined with the ice **9/10**
* Kai Eats and Drinks for dinner. Pizza was surprisingly good! Also a great view with free entertainment in 3 surfers catching some waves. **7.5/10**

In case you didn't know, this week, Hawaiian Electric is asking everyone on the Big Island to reduce power usage between 5 pm and 9 pm. Please turn off air conditioners, avoid doing laundry, use a grill instead of the stove if you can and limit hot water use. So far, rolling blackouts have not been necessary, but they are a real possibility through the rest of the week.

Please help the rest of us by keeping your power usage low, mahalo!

1658789977.0,Oahu Trip Report: 15 outdoor activities we enjoyed,"After multiple trips to Oahu, I finally put together a video summary (not a vlog) of the outdoor activities listed below. [https://youtu.be/XIZEDE6Mapc](https://youtu.be/XIZEDE6Mapc)

Regardless where you are staying, you'll definitely need a car to reach most, if not all of these places. Remember, please take care of yourself and assess your ability and the situation accordingly. Nature does not f\*ck around...

***NORTHERN SIDE***  
1) **Laniakea ""Turtle"" Beach**: Best place to see the Hawaiian green turtle (honu). Usually you can find a couple of them relaxing on the beach. Parking is easier now since they made a makeshift lot on the side of the road.  
2) **Sharks Cove**: Great spot for snorkeling, small tide pools for kids, open water for adults. It's pretty rocky when walking in and out, so water shoes are recommended. Parking is limited so get there early.

***EASTERN SIDE***  
3) **Kualoa Ranch**: They provide a lot of different activities from film location tours, ATV rides, cycling, horseback riding, zipline, taro/farm tours, and more. We did the ATV Hollywood film tour; the film locations were interesting but the highlight of the trip was definitely the valley view. You will get super dusty on their ATV tours.  
4) **Kaneohe Sandbar**: During low-tide the sandbar reveals itself in the middle of Kaneohe Bay! You can only get there by boat or kayak (rent kayaks from [here](https://www.kamaainakidskayaking.org/package/kayak-paddle-snorkel-rentals/)). We liked it so much we did it twice on different trips.  
5) **Lanikai Pillbox Hike**: Nice hike (with some scrambling) to get to 3 pillboxes, although most people stop at the 2nd one. Provides a nice view of the town and beach.  
6) **Old Pali Road Hike**: Relatively easy, and somewhat-paved hike on the old Pali highway. Leads to Pali Lookout Point.

***SOUTHERN SIDE***  
7) **Makapu'u Point Lighthouse Trail**: Easiest ""hike"" on the list, completed paved path leading to the lighthouse and a view of the ocean and island. No shade at all so bring a hat!  
8) **Halona Beach Cove**: Right next to the Halona Blowhole, this small beach does not have a proper pathway to get there and also has warning signs regarding the strong surf and currents. No lifeguards here, so please swim at your own risk.  
9) **Koko Crater Railway Hike**: Hike the old WW2 tram railway straight up to Koko Crater lookout. Beautiful panoramic view at the top.  
10) **Wiliwilinui Ridge Trail**: Popular ridge trail with views of the valley and the entire island. It will get muddy and it will probably rain a bit, regardless of the forecast. First time we went it rained so much halfway up (forecast was clear) that we stopped before the last ascent due to the mud and slippery footing. Second time we went it showered a bit, but I was able to make it to the top. Unfortunately it was completely foggy...

***WESTERN SIDE***  
11) **Electric Beach**: Right next to the electric power plant, the warm water discharged attracts a lot of marine life (came here to see turtles!). Getting in and out of the water can be a bit rough, so we wore life jackets since we weren't super confident in our swimming abilities.   
12) **Mermaid Caves**: During low tide, the caves are no longer submerged. Unless you bring a ladder, it may be a bit difficult getting in and out without some help.   
13) **Ko'olina Lagoons**: Man-made coves near the Disney Aulani and Marriott hotels. The calm waters are great for kids.  
14) **Maili Pink Pillbox Hike**: Popular pillbox hike due to the iconic pink pillbox. A nice, moderate hike that provides awesome views.  
15) **Wild Side Specialty Tours**: We really enjoyed this tour company for marine life interaction. Groups are maxed at 6ppl, providing for a safer and more intimate experience. Staff are also very protective of the sea life, and make sure our interactions do not disturb them.",VisitingHawaii
1658122420.0,[Big Island] What we did in 2.5 days,"Aloha! My friend and I traveled in Big Island for 2.5 days over July 4th weekend. We fly standby so it was a spontaneous trip, which also meant little planning and figuring things out last minute - most of which I checked Reddit popular posts for lol. Overall, it turned out to be an adventure-packed 2.5 days and I was pretty content with what we did and were able to see. So I wanted to share my experience here, in case it is helpful to anyone else! It was both of our first time to Big Island, and my first time to Hawai'i. Btw, I don't necessarily recommend our itinerary. We did really fit a lot into a few days and pushed ourselves.

We arrived late Thursday night from SFO to Kona and grabbed our rental car (went smoothly!) and drove tour Airbnb in the Holualoa area and went to bed. Thanks to jetlag, we were up at 6am the next day.

DAY 1: We went to Kahalu'u Beach Park intending to hang there then realized it was a snorkel spot, so we left and headed to Magic Sands Beach Park. The water was so beautiful and there were people in there boogie boarding and swimming under waves. We joined to also swim under waves, but were not used to the strength of the waves so did not stay very long. Hung out on the shore for a bit and observed the little crabs and fish in the water you could see when the wave went up. We then went to Pine Tree Express - intending to go for breakfast but we got right after they wrapped up breakfast, so we got lunch (Loco Moco). We stopped by Costco to grab snorkels (which we ended up bringing home too). Then the goal was to go to Makalawena Beach but I had missed a turn so we ended up going to Manini'owali Beach. It was a beautiful spot! We settled down and snorkeled for a bit. At this point it was only noon ish. We stayed around 2pm ish, then decided to try to go to Makalawena Beach again. Unfortunately, we had NO idea of the road condition entering into Kekaha Kai State Beach. Our rental was a Camaro... So yeah we drove slowly and probably made it 3/4 way in when we decided to park and walk the rest of the way. At that point we were pretty tired and dehydrated so we walked to Mahai'ula beach and stopped there (didn't make it all the way to Makalawena). We did some snorkeling and swimming and saw a sea turtle snacking away near the rocks, so that was cute! Oh also, the scenery throughout the entire drive and walk was all like lava rock. Felt very otherworldly. Then around 5pm, we drove to Umekes for dinner because Da Poke Shack was closed. We got poke there and unfortunately... it wasn't very good :( My tuna was very salty an the whole thing was pricey. I wondered if we should have order fried fish there instead... Anyways, afterwards we headed to KTA Super stores to see what was different/similar in the offerings. I am Asian btw, so it was nice to see so many snacks all for quite reasonable pricing! We got some snacks and headed back to Magic Sands Beach to watch the sunset before heading home and collapsing.

DAY 2: (we knew we wanted to check out the Volcano National Park, but knew it was a long drive and often it is recommended to spend multiple full days there. We decided to give it a shot and see how much we could fit in one day - and boy we sure did fit a lot. I had crammed my research via Reddit so I knew that we had to prepare for warmer clothing and close-toed shoes, and being aware we needed the energy to drive back to Kona-side at night).

We were up by like 7am so we headed back to Kahalu'u Beach park, this time with our snorkels and snorkeled for a solid 2-3 hours there. It was a lot of fun and we saw many fish! Since we got there early, we avoided the crowds. By the time we got out, it was quite crowded. After, we headed to Da Poke Shack to grab food and see what the hype was about. It was very worth it. We were so hungry we both got platters instead of bowls (bit pricey tho, $35 per platter, $18ish per bowl). The parking lot is crowded and the lines are long so it's good to get in get out. We went to nearby Pahoehoe Beach Park to eat our lunch with a scenic view before starting the drive to the other side of the island, with stops in Punalu'u! The drive was windier than expected, you can see the windiness if you zoom in on the maps. It was okay though because speed limit was 35/45 on those areas and then 55 on the straight parts. Just coming from the mainland, I was more used to mean road ragey drivers and was pleasantly surprised people driving on the Big Island were so chill and didn't mind following behind me (I kept thinking they wanted to pass me lol). The drive was beautiful! Eventually we made it to Punalu'u bake shop. The line looked REALLY long but if you go to the restroom area there is actually another line. IDK if they were the same line, but we lined up in the second line to grab the malasadas. We got the Bismark, Pineapple, and Guava flavors. All so yummy! But ah, so sweet. So decadent. We found a table in outdoors seating and bird watched for a while while eating. Then we drove to Punalu'u black sand beach and decided to just check it out briefly. It's known for having a lot of sea turtles. When we got there, it was mostly people on the beach, however, if you looked closely into the water/waves, the shapes became clear - soooo many sea turtles swimming basically right at shore! It was so cool to see their shells pop up was the waves came up. I quickly ran to grab my snorkels and swam around a bit. It was quite muddy/visibility was not great, but didn't matter - because you could see the many sea turtles just chilling. Tried very hard to keep my distance so I did not want to bump into them! At this point we were already really tired, and we didn't even make it to HVNP yet lol. It was probably around 2pm at this point.

We made the 40ish min drive to HVNP entrance and decided to go in. Before going in, we found a local gas station to refuel real quick and change into warmer/not wet clothes. Anyways, as for the HVNP, I knew there were many things to do there and I didn't think we would get to do that much?? but surprisingly, when you're waiting for it to get dark to check out the lava eruptions, that is actually a lot of hours. We ended up doing way more than I had expected. We first drove the entire Chain of Craters road (so beautiful) and stopped at each sight to take photos. We made it to the end and walked to check the sea arch out and drove back. We then planned to only do the Lava Tube hike, but the parking lot was full (it's a very small one), so we parked at the Kilauea Iki Trailhead. When we realized this trail literally went down to a crater and we could walk across it on top of the lava tube, we were like okay let's do it (it was already 4pm ish at this point). So we did it! We walked through the lava tube (i actually had no idea i was going through it. we had come out of it and i was like wait so where is the lava tube? lol i thought we walked through a regular tunnel. my bad). Anyways, the hike down to the Kilauea Iki was pretty steep and we were already tired but it was manageable. When we made it down to the crater, we didn't walk all the way. Just admired and looked around, took some pics, saw steam vents, stayed on the trail, and headed back up. At that point some other tourists had wandered off trail and kept singing this line from Frozen (Aurora song) to echo through and it was getting annoying tbh! they wouldn't stop. Anyways, the hike up was tiring. What a work out! but we did it and made it to the car. At that point it was 6:30pm ish, and  we didn't want to go yet to the Kilauea Overlook to see the Halem'auma'u eruption because the park ranger had warned us of crowds and said best time to go was after 8-9pm.

So we rested a bit, used the restrooms at the visitor center, and decided to get dinner at Crater Rim cafe. It was surprisingly not crowded at all! Also they had a relatively affordable burger + fries meal ($10.95) w/ refillable drink, so that's what we got. We had dinner and rested a bit. When it was dark we drove to the Kilauea Overlook and by then there were parking spots. We walked over and saw the lava glow (very cool!) more impressive though was the dark night/star visibility. We had decided to drive back to Chain of Craters to do some star gazing but unfortunately, by the time we drove there, it was starting to drizzle. We parked on the Chain of Craters road to wait it out, but the rain only got heavier. At that point, we decided to head back. My friend was more tired (more jetlagged) so he slept at the back of the car and I drove us back to Kona. The entire time we trailed behind this car that was also leaving HVNP. It was nice to not be alone on those roads lol, but the rough part was they drove 5 miles slower than speed limit. That's okay though, we stayed very safe that way. We got back to our Airbnb at like 11:30pm and were SO tired. Cleaned up and collapsed.

DAY 3 (half day): we had to catch a flight later in the afternoon to Honolulu so we only had the first half of the day. It was already on my list to go to Hapuna beach, so that's what we did. We checked out, and headed to Hapuna beach (45 ish min drive). It was a $20 entrance. $10 for the car, $5 per person entry. We brought our snorkels. At first, we stayed in the middle and snorkeled by those rocks and saw 3 sea turtles hanging out! It was very cool. However, I had read online the better snorkeling spots were on either ends of the beach by the rocks. So we decided to head to the right side. The articles I read online did warn us it is a longer swim out there and one must be careful especially with tides/currents/waves. I love snorkeling, so I ended up going out the entire stretch of those rocks and saw so many small fish, a few REALLY big fish (like wow they surprise you), and eventually if you make it to the final stretch, there is actually a coral reef there you can swim around/over with some coral that was alive and many small fish and urchins. Idk at some point the deep blue vastness was so starkly...there, I did get a bit scared. was scared to venture out if I didn't see anyone else out there. Which here, there were not that many people snorkeling. Most people were hanging out on the beach. We hung around at Hapuna until 1130am, before we went to clean up and dry off since the next stop was the airport. Before that though, we went to 808 Grindz Steak to pick up some local food. Cash only! Loved it. I got a steak moco and my friend a spam moco with some juice on the side. We originally wanted to go to Broke Da Mouth but they were closed. Went to Costco for gas before headed to return our rental.

ANYWAYS, that was it! The days went by slow which was nice : ) because we were having so many new experiences and seeing new things. Everyone we met were very kind and chill. At one point on the unpaved road in Kekaha Kai State Beach, someone had even offered to drive us to our parked car when we were walking back. So kind. I was glad that I saw mostly respectful tourists - folks stayed away from wildlife (no one got too close to the sea turtles) and followed local rules for the most part. It was a wonderful experience to get to even see a lil sliver of Big Island.

Hope to be back someday in the future and explore the rest of the island - hopefully much slower. Mahalo Big Island for having us, and for those who read through this post.

P.S. I shared with a friend who grew up in Honolulu photos of Da Poke Shack and they said it looks like a tourist trap and not legit poke. Yay or nay?",VisitingHawaii
1657144205.0,Oahu Post-trip Report,"I spent a mid-June week on Oahu with my husband, his two sons (ages 11 and 12) and my parents (ages 66 and 68). It was interesting planning a trip for such a wide age (and interest) range. My husband and I love diving, hiking, and history, but we compromised pretty heavily for family harmony. Anyway, here's what we did, enjoyed, and didn't so much enjoy!

&#x200B;

We arrived from New York City on Sunday afternoon, picked up our Turo minivan, and headed to Aulani to meet my parents, who had arrived several hours previously. My parents are DVC members, so they booked themselves a 1 BDR villa for the week, while my family had a 2 bedroom villa.

&#x200B;

Aulani is beautiful with lots to do, but it always felt packed with people. We actually liked the location (halfway between the North Shore and Honolulu) and with a rental car, we actually didn't spend a ton of time at the resort. I will say it was great having the kitchen and washer/dryer in the villa, especially since this was week 1 of a 2 week trip.

&#x200B;

The initial plan was to hit Costco Sunday afternoon, but we just did not have time, plus the jetlag had us all feeling like it was 11 PM when it was only 5 PM. All we did Sunday was walk over to Monkeypod Kitchen for an early dinner and crash. Monkeypod was good and had less of a wait than I was expecting. The server we had was truly top-notch (shout out Chris) and made the experience wonderful. The pizzas were good, but my favorites were the poke tacos and the pies for dessert.

&#x200B;

Monday morning I took advantage of the jet lag and dragged my husband and sons out of the resort by 5 AM for a 6:30 shark cage dive from Haleiwa. Cage dive is a bit of a misnomer here -- we were hanging onto the bars of a cage at the surface of the water with snorkels on. It was a very cool experience, albeit one I mainly picked for the boys. They were utterly delighted, and honestly, being so close to these fairly large (up to 10 foot) Galapagos sharks was a trip. They were at some points less than a foot away from us. My 12 year old couldn't stop commenting on how beautiful the water was -- it was a deep blue, ""like paint"" as he said repeatedly.

&#x200B;

I knew we wanted to hit the North Shore beaches afterward. Unfortunately, I couldn't convince my parents to come on the shark dive, so we wound up needing to drive back to Aulani to pick them up. On our way back to the North Shore beaches, on the advice of Redditors, we got breakfast at Kono's. Delicious burritos and very worth the stop. We then went to Waimea Bay where we played in the water and sat on the beach for a bit. This wasn't a huge hit with the family -- my mom found it really difficult to navigate the slope down to the water, and without things like beach chairs and umbrellas, lounging wasn't all that much fun. Also, parking was a huge hassle. After a lackluster 30-ish minutes, we made our way to Shark's Cove to do a bit of snorkeling.

&#x200B;

We actually found parking and somehow navigated our way down to the water. My mom waited up at some picnic tables -- she is not into snorkeling or into traversing rocky beaches. Dad, the boys, and I had a lot of fun snorkeling, although every single one of us came out of the water a little bit bloody. We then made a quick stop at Ted's Bakery (not a ton of baked goods left since it was 3 PM, but we had some good danishes!) and headed back to Aulani to have a relaxing evening by the pool eating pizza.

Tuesday was our day to visit Honolulu. I downloaded two walking tours -- one of the palace area and one of Waikiki. We started early and enjoyed the first tour a lot -- just mostly walking around outside in the area of the palace, listening to stories on my phone. We didn't wind up going into the palace, but we did have a fun little bit of serendipity in Honolulu. The tour took us into City Hall, and while we were just inside the front doors, my mom noticed a car park in the clearly marked Mayor's parking spot. She's not shy, so she didn't hesitate to buttonhole the man walking in from that car... sure enough, it was the mayor of Honolulu. I know nothing about the man's politics, but he was very nice and took a picture with us. Sometimes, it's the things you can't plan that really stand out!

&#x200B;

After the first walking tour, we had lunch at Duke's in the Outrigger. The food was fine, the view was lovely, and the Hula pie was worth the price. After lunch we did the Waikiki walking tour, which was not nearly as interesting as the earlier tour. We also had to rush a bit, because the boys and I were parasailing at 4 PM (I couldn't talk anyone else into it.) I had a decent time, but the real enjoyment was seeing how much my sons loved flying a few hundred feet off the ocean.

&#x200B;

Wednesday was totally devoted to Pearl Harbor. This was my mom's must-see, and my husband really wanted to see the USS Missouri, as his great uncle was actually serving on the ship when the Japanese surrendered. We got to the visitor's center as early as possible and bought the Passport to Pearl Harbor, although I don't think we wound up using enough of it to be worthwhile. We walked around the USS Missouri (although I had seen it when it was in Bremerton, WA when I was a pre-teen) and then we made our way to a special tour my mom had booked. 

&#x200B;

My dad was a Naval officer for 20 years, and my parents have friends who are currently stationed at Pearl Harbor. Through an O-6 friend, they were able to book some sort of special military tour of the USS Arizona memorial... but only 4 spots. Since I had seen the Arizona years ago and my 11 year old was VERY over historical tours at this point, my parents, my husband, and my 12 year old did the tour while the 11 year old and I got some impromptu McDonald‚Äôs and drove up to Tantalus Lookout to eat it. After their tour was over, we had some time to head to the Aviation Museum on Ford‚Äôs Island (helped by the fact that my dad could drive right on to the base) before we had to leave for‚Ä¶.

&#x200B;

Chief‚Äôs Luau! The luau was the one thing we knew we had to do that I don‚Äôt think I would ever do again. It was crowded, the food was fine but not great, and the show dragged a bit. That said, Chief himself was very funny and charming, and the fire knife finale was jaw-dropping.

&#x200B;

Thursday was a free day, which meant we spent the morning at the resort‚Ä¶ where unfortunately, my mother slipped and cracked her face on a wooden handrail by the Aulani pools. I think the poor woman got a hairline fracture in her cheekbone, but she soldiered on for the remaining 10 days of the vacation without complaint. The uninjured five of us wound up spending Thursday afternoon/early evening doing a driving tour of the North Shore. Kono‚Äôs was so good we stopped for lunch there. We didn‚Äôt make a lot of stops on the tour ‚Äì we vetoed the Dole Plantation and were way too late in the day for the Polynesian Cultural Center (and not that interested) ‚Äì but we did get some garlic shrimp, lovely photos, and interesting stories. My 11 year old played with his tablet in the car and had the nerve to complain about being bored, heaven save me.

Friday was an ambitious day. I booked us time at Diamond Head from 8 AM to 10 AM, and since we had to meet a scuba boat at 10:15, I led a forced march up with strictly timed picture opportunities and water breaks. My mother stayed at the resort and had friends visit, and my father (who is in good shape for a 68 year old) made it up and down the mountain with the rest of us in about 85 minutes of total hiking time, which I don‚Äôt think is too bad! It was beautiful if packed at the top, and I don‚Äôt regret squeezing this in at all.

&#x200B;

My father and my sons are not Scuba certified but were interested in trying it. I actually found a Discover Scuba class that would let them dive two tanks each off of a boat, even without certification. We were within sight of the shore and not down more than 30 feet, so it wasn‚Äôt the most exciting dive for me or my husband, but the 11 year old took to it like a fish. I think we‚Äôre going to have to get him certified. The guide on the boat tried to talk us into diving the lava tubes at Shark‚Äôs Cove with him, but we were out of time on Oahu. It did sound fun, though, so next time!

&#x200B;

Saturday, we did a morning snorkeling cruise out of Ko Olina on a catamaran that also did a buffet lunch. My mother came on the boat but elected not to snorkel. The rest of us spent about an hour in the water. Between being on the leeward side of the island and it being morning, the waters were lovely and calm. The snorkel spot they took us to was I guess near a turtle cleaning station? The crew threw food in the water to draw the fish, which is obviously not a great practice. That said, it made for really wonderful snorkeling. We saw three sea turtles at various points, so close that we had to work to keep the legally-mandated 6-foot distance. Between the turtles and the fish, they made up for the coral not being very interesting. We also saw spinner dolphins very close to the boat, putting on a show for us and spinning out of the water. I have mixed feelings about the cruise overall, but it was the highlight of the trip for my dad.

&#x200B;

After the cruise, we headed back to Aulani to get ready to check out and fly to the Big Island on Sunday! (I will write that up, too‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a threat or a promise.)

&#x200B;

All in all, I loved our time on Oahu. It made me really want to head back with just my husband and myself and do more diving, more hiking, more foodie stuff in Honolulu, and see some of the east side of the island.",VisitingHawaii

1701260216.0,Manta Ray tour on the Big Island. Worth it?,"UPDATE: We did the manta ray snorkel with Manta Ray Advocates and it was AMAZING!!! Thank you so much to everyone that encouraged us to do it. It was absolutely worth it! 

My husband and I will be on the Big Island for a week Dec 14-21 with our family. I was considering booking a manta ray tour just for he and I, but I have read that the water may be choppy and a lot of people spend the tour being sea sick. With that in mind, I am trying to gauge if the tour is worth it. It seems like people either love it or hate it. 

And also are there better experiences out there? I was also looking at zip lining as a possible second option.  

We will also be traveling with our 3 year old so activity/tour suggestions that are good for kids are also welcome. I was considering taking my daughter on the Atlantis submarine tour but wasn‚Äôt sure if she would be too young.

EDIT: thank you so much for all your feedback!! We decided to do the tour with Manta Ray Advocates, after hearing some great reviews. It also allows us the opportunity to skip a boat ride and even make an evening out of it since they operate out of a resort. It sounds like there also were definitely folks who got sick and that does sound miserable. Fingers crossed we‚Äôll make it without losing our lunch! Thanks again! ",VisitingHawaii

Definitely plan on checking out some of the beaches, snorkeling, seeing a show, but looking for the following advice:

-Hiking trails for beginners

-What is the best Luau to attend?

-Do I need a car?

-Great restaurants to eat at

-Nightlife activities

1697144456.0,Helicopter tour. Is it worth the money?,"My partner and I are planning a 4-night trip to Hawaii. A 60 minute tour around the island costs about $800-900 for both of us. To give you some perspective, our round trip airfare to Honolulu was only $1050.

We're kind of torn about it. On one hand, it feels like we're about to spend way too much for just an hour of excitement. But on the other hand, the idea of soaring over Hawaii's beauty is incredibly thrilling. We're not planning on doing other ‚Äúbig‚Äù activities like snorkeling or anything of the sort. We do have a Manoa Falls hike planned and we will be exploring the island by car on one of the days and will check out the Lanakai Pillbox before we head up the north shore. 

So, here's the big question: Is this heart-pounding helicopter ride worth the serious dent it makes in our budget? I wouldn't even think of taking a helicopter ride back home (cost not a consideration), but in Hawaii, it seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

We can afford it, it just feels‚Ä¶ a bit reckless? Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you go for it, and was it worth every penny? We'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences!",VisitingHawaii

We're mostly focusing on Maui and Kauai, but I could't resist the idea of flying in to KOA and visiting Volcanoes for the day before flying to Maui or Kauai as we love our national parks!

1699927009.0,Kauai Recap,"My wife and I just got home from a week long honeymoon on Kauai. We stayed near Kapaa as we liked the idea of being centrally located and we had several activites booked in the area.

If you want to spend time in Ocean, Poipu Beach was our favorite. Going in November the water was rough on the North Shore, it made for great surf watching though. For a calmer beach on the North side, we liked Anini Beach.

Be adaptable. I was very worried about the weather forecast the week before as rain was forecasted everyday.  And it did rain almost every day, most of the time for less than 5 minutes at a time. If you have activies that are based around the weather, book them early so you have time to reschedule if it does rain a lot. Our Kayak tour was initially booked for Tuesday, but we had to reschedule for Friday due to high river levels.

Thank you for letting us share your home for a week. We fell in love with the island during our time and can't wait to come back. ü§ô

Favorite Activites:

Waimea Canyon - Canyon Trail 

Jurassic Falls Helicopter Tour

Secret Falls Kayak Trip 

Lydgate Chocolate Farm - This wasn't planned, but we added this after our helicopter tour on Wednesday. My wife struggles with motion sickness, so we left the afternoon open depending on how she felt.

Favorite Food:

I had a lot of reservations booked at higher end restaurants, but ending up cancelling most of them. Our most expensive meal of the trip was the most under whelming, so we went with more casual eating options.

The Hanalei Gourmet - Fish Tacos were amazing, as was the Ceviche

Fish Bar Deli in Kapaa - Fish of the day sandwich was swordfish

Al Pastor  in Kapaa- Mahi Mahi and shrimp tacos

Puka Dog in Poipu - my wife loved it, wasn't my favorite

Golf:

I have a lovely wife that knows how important golf is to me. I was lucky enough to book 2 rounds of golf on our trip at Poipu Bay and Princeville Makai. Both courses are very open off the tee, but Makai required more thinking as water and elevation changes are more in play.",VisitingHawaii

1695334982.0,Finalizing hotel in Waikiki - would love some help!,"Hey all,

Heading to Waikiki at the end of October/Early November. My dates are flexible at the moment, just gonna pick whichever has the best flight/hotel prices. 

We're both in our 30s so looking for somewhere overall quiet.

Would you suggest 4 nights at a much nicer place or having an extra night at a slightly less nice place?

**OUTRIGGER Waikiki Beachcomber** \- $1815 - 5 nights

**Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki**  \- $1716 - 4 nights - out of our ideal budget to do 5 nights here

**Prince Waikiki - $**1792 - also 4 nights

**Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head - $**1759- also 4 nights

**Hilton Waikiki Beach -** $1554 - 5 nights

All prices are with taxes/fees included already.

Trying to stay away from airbnb/rental type stuff since I don't wanna fund someone with no ties to Hawaii itself other than property, so I'm avoiding stuff like the Ilikai/Ali'i rentals even though they're way cheaper.

All the above are ocean views cuz I figure going to Hawaii and not seeing the ocean as much as possible would be a bummer, even if we're not spending a ton of time in the room overall.

Thanks!",VisitingHawaii
1686511460.0,Camping in Kauai,"I thought it was pretty hard to get info online about how to not spend hundreds of dollars on the different lodging options in Kauai. We hesitated a bunch before moving forward with our plan to use only county campgrounds, among other things because there aren't many trip reports about those. So there you go! :)

We spent 10 days in Kauai, and slept in county campgrounds the whole time. We tried three of them (with a quick TLDR in parenthesis):

1. **Salt Pond Beach Park** (decent location, roosters will wake you up in the morning, somewhat windy, does have a bunch of cockroaches, BBQ grill with no propane tank + some little standing metal boxes to grill with a fire)
2. **Anahola Beach Park** (tougher crowd, very noisy crashing waves throughout the nights, someone slashed our rental car's gas pipe during a night, not recommended)
3. **Anini Beach Park** (definitely the best one, can't think of negatives although I can't recall if there were showers or BBQs)

\---

A longer write-up:

**Cost**? All only 3 USD$ per night. (Or free if you are resident.)

**Verification**? We saw absolutely no one requesting to see our permits, despite seeing employees doing maintenance on the site. Moreover, the only place we saw people displaying their permits outside their tent is at Anini. For the end of our trip, we were supposed to return to Salt Pond from Anahola, but we decided to try out Anini without having the permits (we had the ones for Salt Pond) and it turned out fine. But do bear in min we weren't in ""high-season"" yet: this was during the month of May.

**Maintenance**? Some people do show up to clean the bathrooms, and empty the trash cans. That's about all I've seen.

**Closures**? Each campground closes on a (different) given day of the week for a ""deep-clean"". We did not stick around to see what they actually do during that moment. It seems like the main reason is to prevent homeless people from simply establishing a permanent camp there.

**Amenities**? Salt Pond and Anini had picnic tables and a few street lights so some areas would be lit throughout the night. I can't recall for Anahola. All three had bathrooms. Both Salt Pond and Anahola had outdoor shower heads that we used to wash ourselves (Anini was too big, and we didn't stay long enough to fully explore what it had to offer). There were electrical outlets in all 3 campgrounds, but we didn't get to try them out as we had bought a battery-pack to charge our electronics throughout the trip.

**Safety/Crowd**? Everyone (tourists and locals alike) we met at all 3 campgrounds were friendly. There were always legit camping tents around, and some cheaper ones too. Salt Pond and Anini felt very safe. The surroundings at Anahola were a good foretell of what was to come: there are some broken cars that have clearly been sitting there for multiple years... we nonetheless spent 3 nights there and had no apparent trouble, until we tried to refill our rental car to return it and realized someone had slashed our gas pipe to try to siphon gas. At all 3 campgrounds, we left our tent up all day while we were away, and left a bunch of stuff in it as well (sleeping pad, sleeping bag, clothing, toothbrush, etc.): nothing got stolen.

**Noise**? Salt Pond hosted a big party during the weekend, but aside from that only the roosters in the morning were noisy. Noise-wise at Anahola, only the very loud crashing waves were a bit annoying throughout the night. Anini was very peaceful and nice.

**Navigation**? You just type the campground's name, and head to their associated beach (which will be where Google Maps sends you anyways). Tents are easy to spot, and parking places are obvious too.

**Food**? We had our camping stove with us. Salt Pond had some minor amenities for you to cook with fire, or if you have a BBQ propane gas tank. Not many restaurant options around Anahola. Some decent stuff not too far of a drive from Salt Pond. More options around Anini.

**Beach**? Salt Pond has a little protected bay, so waves weren't crazy and it was easy to swim, but the water wasn't very clear. Anahola had big waves, and we didn't end up swimming around there. Anini had a very calm beach, but we didn't swim there either (Hanalei was just next door!)... it seemed like it was very shallow so maybe not the most pleasing swim?

**Activities**? Around Salt Pond you have Waimea Canyon, and a lot of boat tour departure locations. Near Anahola, you have the Wailua River. Near Anini there is the Napali Coast trail, and Hanalei beach.

\---

Now about non-camping related stuff:

* **Moving around**: we rented a car with Rent-A-Wreck. The employees are nice. Had to return the first car after a day due to some potential battery problem: they provided an upgrade for free. Ended up having a slashed pipe due to someone trying to siphon gas... it cost us 40$ admin fee + 40$ pipe cost + 120$ labor, but they did round down the final price. Without this added cost, it was 550$ (if paid cash) for 10 days.
* **Eating out**: hours are limited, food is very pricy, and the quality wasn't very good. Definitely was disappointed by that part.
* **Money**: there is a 3% surcharge on all credit card transactions, so if you have a lot of paper money with you (potentially not recommended?) you'll save this much I guess...
* **Activities**:
   * the boat tour was great: the Napali coast is absolutely beautiful
   * Hanalei beach is super scenic and has great sunsets
   * we didn't take the heli ride
   * we drove up Waimea Canyon 4 times and stopped at all lookouts every time: it was nice to see the sceneries in different weathers. The very last stop was always in the clouds, so we never got to see the Napali coast from that side.
   * Wailua River: we enjoyed not paying for a guide since it allowed us to see the falls before crowds came in and cost us half the price. The hike was nice, but not breathtaking... same for the fall. You can swim in the hole, and even walk behind the waterfall: that was a pretty intense and cool thing to try out. Rent from ""Wailua Kayak & Canoe"" (169 Wailua Rd) so you can just bring the kayak to the water without needing to put them on top of your car.
   * Napali hike: worth it. Absolutely not as hard as they advertise it (""8.9/10, and 10 is Mount Everest"" type of stuff).",VisitingHawaii
1682540917.0,Flying Hawaiian Airlines nonstop from Boston to Honolulu. Should I cough up the money for an upgrade to comfort plus?,"My partner and I currently have seats close to the back of the plane (37B and 37A). Flight is 4-5 months out. Plane still pretty empty. No AC/outlet power in current selected seats. Considering ""comfort plus"" upgrade to seats 11H and 11J - is the $255/additional cost per person worth it for the extra legroom+privacy+AC power? FWIW we got a great price on the initial coach seats ($450 per person). 

If we should do it - should we do it both ways, or only on the overnight flight back? Our incoming flight isn't overnight. Thank you in advance. We have family in Hawaii that we'll be seeing and this will be our first visit.

1679152141.0,Tips for dealing with car break ins?,"I'm planning on visiting Oahu, Kauai, and Maui in May and I've heard there is a lot of car break ins in Hawaii. I plan to rent a car every day on each of the islands. What I gathered so far are

1. Don't leave anything valuable visible in the car.
2. Or just don't leave anything valuable at all in the car and leave the car unlocked so thieves don't break the window to find out.

I'm moving around hotels at some point and will need to carry all of my luggage in the car for half a day in between. How do I keep my wallet, phone, and keys safe when I'm out snorkeling? I read I shouldn't leave them out on the beach either. So just buy a waterproof bag and carry it with me the whole time?

Will the rest of my luggage (check in bags) be safe in the trunk as long as they're not visible from the outside? Will theives break into the car and open the trunk to steal luggage if they don't see anything valuable up front? Leaving the car unlocked probably won't work with leaving the luggage in the trunk.

Some places I plan to visit are

Oahu

1. Electric Beach
2. NƒÅnƒÅkuli Beach Park
3. MƒÅkua Beach
4. Haleiwa (shark diving)
5. Kualoa regional park
6. Lanikai beach

I'm mostly worried about Oahu because that's where I'll spend the most time carrying luggage in my car. Are there some places that I need to be especially careful? I heard that if you leave anything in the car near Makua beach, don't expect it to be there when you get back...",VisitingHawaii

&#x200B;

I'm really sorry to see what's happening in Maui. Hope people are safe and get all the help needed. I'm from an area which gets a lot of forest fires every year - so I understand how difficult it is to recover from this and how it impacts the locals. 

On my trip - I had a trip planned for next week to Maui, but cancelled it due to the fire and ensure locals get the resources they need. Given I already planned a trip mentally and took off from work - I would like to do something and if possible another island in Hawaii. 

I'm traveling with LO and 2 kids - 3 & 7. Both kids can do minor hikes but not too good at swimming or water sports. However would like to play at nice beaches, look at some corals/animals like fish or turtles, see some nature. Trying to make it a relaxing trip. Which island is better - has some scenic places, good beaches, mix of urban and nature. Will rent a car, so driving is not an issue. 

Should I look at any other island in Hawaii or go somewhere else and come back to Maui once it's back in business. ",VisitingHawaii

Due diligence for someone seeking knowledge from this sub is visiting the many great links on the sidebar, including u/webrender 's excellent [Oahu guide](https://webrender.net/oahuguide) (I'd love to learn how to code that someday, great job).

My husband and I are visiting BI this week for anniversary celebrations. Here is our rough itinerary. I welcome all suggestions/tips/warnings as this is our first time in Hawaii. 

From my brief research, I am aware that we need to avoid driving around a lot. Hopefully, we don't fall into that trap. Everything but the AirBnB stays and Manta Ray snorkel is flexible at this point. 

We stay in Kona for two nights and Mountain View near HVNP for two nights

&#x200B;

02/16: 

* Flight lands in KOA at 1:00 pm, pick up rental car
* Quick lunch at Pine Tree Cafe (suggestions welcome, okay with something basic)
* Drop bags at airbnb (Kona)
* Drive to Hapuna beach or Beach 69 (tihihi). Chill there till \~5pm. 
* Dinner at Umekes, watch sunset at closest beach(?)
* Manta Ray snorkel at Keauhou starts at 7:40pm. 

&#x200B;

02/17: 

* Coffee/brunch (island corner cafe?)
* Mountain Thunder coffee plantation tour
* Polynesian ATV tour booked for 1:00 pm (is this worth $220 per head? Can cancel till 16th) /Alternatively, drive up to Pololu Valley lookout (leave early and do mountain thunder on the way back if this is the plan)
* Basic dinner at airBnB (ready to cook or something from a local deli)

&#x200B;

02/18: 

* Drive early to Hilo beach, quick bite on the way (open to recommendations for both)
* Rainbow falls 
* Hilo Brewing + downtown Hilo
*  Kaumana Caves
* Dinner at Saucy Mama LLC, pick up packable lunch for next day from local deli/food store
* Stay at AirBnB in Mountain View

&#x200B;

02/19

* Saving a full day for a long hike (13-16 miles) or multiple small hikes with views and driving around HVNP. I am so spoilt for choice! Please help! Devastation seems like a good point to start? Is [this](https://wanderingwagars.com/hawaii-volcanoes-national-park/) too ambitious. Do some parts?
* Grab dinner from tuk tuk thai food truck (if back in time)/ Thai Thai bistro and bar

&#x200B;

02/20: 

* Catch sunrise from somewhere in the park (Halemaumau crater?)
* Drive down to green sands beach (chill for an hour or so, is that too ambitious?) drive to two step
* Breakfast at sacred ground coffee farms / brunch at shaka tacoz (have to be there by 11)
* leave for airport by 11:30 KOA flight at 2 pm

Edit: We did most of the above despite the rain!! Tried to make the most of it! Here are some suggestions based on our trip. 


Day1: 
- Our experience with Pine Tree Cafe was not that great. We did grab a cappuccino from Kona Mountain Coffee which is in the same complex and that was amazing! 
- Hapuna beach is truly beautiful. Lots of places to just chill or go in the water and ride the wave. Enough parking too. 
- Umekes -  Hands down the best fish tacos, hell, the best tacos we have ever had! 
- the waters were rough that night so the Manta Ray snorkeling got rescheduled to next day too. But it was life-changing!! Note that our boat was lucky and had two manta rays spend a lot of time around us. They are huge friendly and magnificent! 

Day2: 
- We had a quick bite at tealicious instead. Good food, good tea. Coffee was okay. Cute vibes 
- the mountain thunder coffee tour was alright. But it was free so all good. The sample coffee itself that they have was also meh, honestly. But that too was free so nothing lost. Maybe go to Buddha Bowl instead as someone recommended in the comments.
- I would 100% recommend doing the ATV tour! For me that and manta ray were the highlights. I absolutely loved every minute of the thrill. We did it in heavy rain and that made our experience all the more fun! 

Day3: 
- Gabbed coffee, coconut scone, and croissant from Holuakoa coffee instead. Would highly recommend this. Again, great vibes, good food. 
- We were tempted to do Akaka falls on the way but it's a tourist trap. Thanks to reviews on all trails, we didn't do this. 
- We did Caumana caves instead. Absolutely amazing, especially in the rain. There was water and waterfalls inside throughout. Make sure to have headlights and good waterproof boots or sandals (no slippers). 
- We did Ola brewing instead of Hilo brewing. Loved their dragon fruit cider. All other beers were basic (we took a sampler, won't recommend doing that) 
- We grabbed dinner from New Chiang Mai Thai. Portion sizes were great. We made two dinners out of it! 

Day4: 
- it rained a lot. Like a lot so we did not have much visibility at any of the eruption points in HVNP. Still had fun..
- We did the free ranger guided tour of the crater. So informative. I would highly recommend this. 
- Do drive downt to the sea. The arches and the area near that are beautiful. 

Day5: 
- The coffee shack in Captain Cook had a 1 hour wait. Decided to go to Menehuna Coffee Honaunau. The food was good but extremely expensive. Would not recommend. 
We picked up lunch for the flight from Shaka Tacoz. It turned out to be delicious. Should have just had brunch here at 11am.

1670228863.0,MaunaLoa Volcano Eruption,"Cross Post from [https://twitter.com/sudhishkr/status/1598258782131617792](https://twitter.com/sudhishkr/status/1598258782131617792)

During my visit to the National Park in Big Island - I could only see Kilauea volcano with some sightings of lava on 27th‚ÄôNov evening. I left the park that evening, and later found out that the worlds largest volcano MaunaLoa had erupted later that night at \~1130pm after \~38yrs.

[day1](https://preview.redd.it/31lorwemh14a1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=33fee5ef12e42f4290ac2b4c1a53063fc36e332d)

Next day, I could see 2 eruptions from the same point inside the Volcano National Park. The nearer one is Kilauea, with MaunaLoa in the back. This was a spectacular sighting in the night.

[day2](https://preview.redd.it/0sgl3u0oh14a1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3e1d72be88b3962b77df04a099ae89637030ca0)

On the third day, MaunaLoa started having increased lava flows. Saddle road had the best sighting. The night sky was glowing orange in color. The lava appeared to be flowing towards Big Island‚Äôs Saddle road (an important highway for locals & tourists).

[day3-img1](https://preview.redd.it/78dzirsph14a1.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=ace7b3dd7a89e74a430d9c35f06b234c99fbe524)

And yes, the highway was clogged. Nevertheless it was very interesting to see the lava flow from a safe distance. Thanks [@Volcanoes\_NPS](https://twitter.com/Volcanoes_NPS) & [@USGSVolcanoes](https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes).

1664325494.0,Honolulu Trip Review & Highlights!,"My husband (29M) & I (28F) just returned from week in Honolulu and wanted to share some highlights! It was my 2nd time to the islands but my husband‚Äôs first. 

This subreddit has been so helpful in the planning of our trip so I thought this might help someone out too! 

We stayed at the Embassy Suites Beach Walk in Waikiki from 09/18 - 09/23 for our one year anniversary. The hotel itself was fine, a little outdated but was clean and it was nice to have a separate area from the bedroom to put our things. 

Activities:
- SUP yoga class at Ala Moana Beach ‚Äî> we have never done either SUP or yoga but had a fantastic time doing this!
- Diamond Head hike ‚Äî> that view is absolutely amazing 
- Nutridge luau ‚Äî> fantastic experience with equally fantastic food, not gimmicky at all
- North shore tour ‚Äî> I know lots of people recommend renting a car to do it yourself but my husband & I appreciate someone else doing the driving along with the history lesson and jokes our tour guide had
- Shopping at Ala Moana ‚Äî> the Uniqlo here has Hawaii only tshirts!!! 
- Lots of lounging around on beaches, it is Hawaii after all! 

Food:
- Tonkatsu at Ginza Bairin ‚Äî> 10/10, my husband‚Äôs favourite meal of the trip
- Nature Waikiki ‚Äî> we did the tasting menu at the chef‚Äôs counter for our anniversary dinner and it was another 10/10
- Poke from Foodland ‚Äî> endless choices, really liked the hamachi
- Marukame Udon ‚Äî> waited 47 minutes for this and it was good but not 47 minute wait good haha

1662797144.0,[Oahu][Big Island] September 2022 trip report,"We spent one week on Oahu and one week on the Big Island in September 2022. Here are the things we liked and didn‚Äôt like. Keep in mind these are our opinions and you may feel differently.

Oahu:
- Hikes: Kuliouou ridge trail was our favorite hike with lots of shade in the early morning and a good overlook at the summit. We were the first to hike it, and really liked it being quiet on the way up. Moana Falls was a mellower and shorter hike that was a runner up. The Ehukai pillbox hike takes a third place. Diamond Head hike was alright, too many people and no shade. The $4 audio tour made it more interesting. We decided not to do Lulumahu Falls hike because the reviews said it was muddy and challenging. We also decided against the Lanikai Pillbox hike because we started late that day and there was no available parking. Glad we did, and instead‚Ä¶
- Rented a full day kayak from Sun and Salt Adventures (highly recommend them) and kayaked to the Flat Island and the Mokes. You have to have a vehicle and they help you load. It was our first time kayaking in the ocean and it wasn‚Äôt as challenging as I thought it would be. Plan to spend a day, bring food, water and snorkeling gear.
- Hanauma Bay is a big rip-off. Tickets are $25/each, and we saw almost no marine life while snorkeling. Instead go to Sharks Cove, bring water shoes or fins due to the rocky bottom there.
- We booked a package tour at Kualoa Ranch, it wasn‚Äôt bad, but nothing to write home about. The package included Movie Site and Ranch Tour, Jungle Expedition Tour and Aina (farm) Tour. Buffet lunch was included and was subpar. I didn‚Äôt appreciate that they told us the check-in time was 8:30, but the first tour didn‚Äôt start until 9:45 or so.
- Dole Plantation was alright with their overpriced and not so ono whips. I liked their pineapple cutting presentation.
- We didn‚Äôt have time to check out the Electric Beach, which a local told us has good marine life, but she also said to be prepared to be a good swimmer or have a floating device.
- Pearl Harbor: although we reserved a USS Arizona Tour, they didn‚Äôt let us in because we were literally 2 minutes late. Do not bring backpacks or purses, get there 10-15 minutes early, otherwise you‚Äôll have to wait an hour or longer in the standby queue despite the reservation, like we did.
- Bought a Parasailing groupon and enjoyed a good view of Waikiki from the boat.
- Had a docent tour at Iolani Palace. It felt very rushed and confusing at times.  The docent never once asked if anyone had a question and most of the staff didn‚Äôt seem very friendly. 
- We stayed in Ilikai Marina, which had a nice view, but if we have to do it again we‚Äôd pick the east side of Oahu due to lighter traffic and the beautiful green cliffs. One evening we ordered takeout from Adela‚Äôs and ate it at a nearby park facing the cliffs.
- Food: Liko‚Äôs was average; the malasadas at Leonard‚Äôs did not live up to the hype and getting 6 or 12 is not cheaper than individual ones. Dinner at 53 By the Sea wasn‚Äôt bad, but not worth the higher price, service was great. Foodland poke was better than expected, and frozen ahi tina poke was not worse than twice as expensive fresh ahi. Surprisingly, the mangosteens from Costco and Pressed juice were the food highlights. Ube cheesecake at Adela‚Äôs was so good, but the 2 kinds of noodle dishes I found ok. Got served a super greasy omelet at Duke‚Äôs Waikiki; that made the buffet a negative experience.
- Overall we didn‚Äôt feel the Aloha spirit on Oahu and didn‚Äôt feel relaxed like we did on other islands.

Big Island
- The highlight was snorkeling with the manta rays. Bring a GoPro! We went with Manta Ray Dives of Hawaii, and while on the island discovered that local Costco sells $100/person 2-hr tours with Kona Snorkel Trips. We had ours booked months in advance and decided not to switch.
- We didn‚Äôt drink coffee in our rental, because the Kona side has a lot of coffee farms that offer free estate coffee tastings. We booked a tour with Heavenly Hawaiian and enjoyed it. They charge a small tour fee, but there are other farms that do not, that we also recommend, such as Hula Tree and Greenwell. Sampled coffee and tea at Buddha Cup, and wish we had more time to explore their grounds. Kona Joe farm was a pleasant surprise with a nice view.
- Touring Big Island Bees was another favorite. We bought 3 of their unique honeys.
- We booked a Morning Kealakekua Snorkel Tour with Fair Wind, and it was another highlight. The included breakfast and lunch were surprisingly tasty, and the marine life in that bay was the best out of all 4 main islands. This spot is also known as Captain Cook bay.
- We attempted to snorkel in this spot on another day, but from the ground it was only accessible by hiking about 2 miles one way, and we instead decided to go to the nearby Manini beach. So glad we did, because it‚Äôs well maintained with lots of shade and picnic tables. Snorkeling was also good.
- Your National Park pass will work at Pu'uhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park (aka Place of Refuge), otherwise it‚Äôs $20. We snorkeled at the nearby Two Step beach, although Kealakekua was much better. Afterwards we visited the park. They show an informative movie and have a ranger talk.
- Plan a day to visit Volcanoes National Park and don‚Äôt forget your binoculars (like we did). There was a small piece of active lava only visible after sundown and at a distance.
- Akaka Falls was a nice short hike, but be prepared to pay $10/car + $5/person.
- We drove the entire island around to explore various lookouts (Waipio, Pololu, etc), sometimes having our convertible top down. BI is perfect for that.
- Ziplining was another BI must do from our research. Although we‚Äôve done it before elsewhere, it wasn‚Äôt as exciting and too slow, with a lot of waiting around (3 hours total). At almost $500 for 2 people it wasn‚Äôt worth it for us.
- The drive to Mauna Kea was somewhat interesting through the clouds, but if you‚Äôre doing it for stargazing, we had a similar view of the stars during the drive from Volcano‚Äôs NP to Kona.
- I liked the art galleries on Ali‚Äôi drive.
- Gertrude‚Äôs and Huggo‚Äôs had good live music - check out their website for scheduled performances.
- Food: We mostly ate breakfast at our oceanfront rental. Bought starfruit and mangosteen from Hilo Farmer‚Äôs Market (the Costco ones were better). Gypsea Gelato and Nicoco‚Äôs Gelato were both good. Umeke‚Äôs food was too salty and you‚Äôre probably better off ordering from  their adjacent market. Were served fish tacos drenched in oil at Pineapples in Hilo (gross). Enjoyed a birthday lunch at Ha Bar located inside a five star resort Mauna Lani; service was impeccable and they made it feel special.

Overall, we liked BI better and felt more relaxed there. This year we didn‚Äôt book any restaurants like we did last year on Kauai and Maui, because we didn‚Äôt know what time we would feel hungry or be done with our activities. We wanted something flexible for an audio tour and used GyPSy because Shaka has fixed tours. We used Shaka on Maui last year and enjoyed it there.",VisitingHawaii

1658004990.0,Big Island / Maui Trip Review - January 2022 (Part 1),"Hello Reddit! This group was extremely helpful for our Hawaii research I was hoping to repay the favor in our itinerary of Hawaii. First off, download the Shaka app, you can thank me later. Shaka can be used throughout all Hawaiian islands (national parks, road to Hana, random drives along the coast, etc.). Secondly, if going to Maui, book your Mamas Fish House reservation as you‚Äôre reading this. Mamas Fish House books 5 months in advance. 

Traveled in January and loved the weather! Only rained once while driving. I‚Äôve heard this is the rainy season so maybe we got lucky. 

This post is for Big Island only. The second half of our trip to Maui will be posted soon. Hope notes below help!


BIG ISLAND:

Day 1:
- Long flight from east coast to Big Island
- land to Kona and get rental car. Took a shuttle to enterprise rental and was relatively quick 
- Kona brewing company - cool brewery and would recommend the stop but food was mediocre 

Day 2:
- Woke up at 4AM due to time difference
- Early start to Waipio valley - Best hike of the trip. Super steep going down (paved road) and black sand beach at the bottom. Reviews said possibility to see wild horses but we weren‚Äôt that lucky. Reviews also said beach is accessible via 4 wheel car. Honestly looked pretty scary and wouldn‚Äôt risk it. Exercise is good for the soul :)  EDIT: hike closed to the public as of February. Sorry! 
- Downtown Kona shopping. Small strip but check it out.
- Kona coffee cafe - great coffee. Free tasting
- Dinner at island lava Java - get the salmon pineapple. Would recommend. 

Day 3:
- Kona coffee and tea 
- captain cook snorkeling with Sequest - if you‚Äôre looking for a snorkel trip would recommend this location. Super clear and calm waters with cool fish. Even the coral was cool. 
- Umeke‚Äôs for lunch - fine but nothing special. Could skip. 
- Greenwell farms for coffee tour. MUST hit. Free tours and great coffee. 
- On The Rocks for dinner. No reservation was originally a 2 hour wait. After 20 minutes our table was ready. Amazing views and great food. Definitely worth it!

Day 4:
- green sand beach hike - A bit of a drive from Kona but don‚Äôt follow Google maps. 1 of the 2 green sand beaches in the US. Long hike from parking lot to the beach. If you go early you‚Äôll basically have the place to yourself. Most people don‚Äôt stay more than an hour. You can pay the locals $20 each to drive instead of hike, but that‚Äôs no fun
- Luau - island breeze. In downtown kona and would recommend if you want to check a luau out. Food was actually pretty good and luau was affordable compared to Maui options 

Day 5:
- brunch at kalikala - solid brunch spot and i think had good bloodies. 
- HiCO - Hawaiian Coffee. Just another coffee spot because why not. 
- Kaloko-Honok≈çhau National Historical Park. Cool area to walk around by the water and see some turtles! 
- Kiholo Bay hike - my least favorite hike but the destination was worth it. Ended up in a Bay where nobody else was. Swam with some turtles. Wear sneakers, not flip flops for this! 
- Da poke shack for lunch. BEST POKE!
- Night manta ray with Torpedo tours. MUST DO!!! So many different touring options. Our original tour got cancelled last minute but we got lucky with Torpedo tours. Water can be rough so be prepared but truly once in a lifetime experience 

Day 6:
- Depart Kona and begin drive to Volcano
- Kaumana Caves - easy stop on the way to Volcano national park area. Caves are a little sketch. Bring flashlight and don‚Äôt use your phone. Our phones didn‚Äôt work for a while after. 
- Short N Sweet Bakery & Cafe - not worth a stop. 
- Volcano park. Listened to ranger at visitor center 
- Kilauea Iki trail and crater rim. Tied in thurston lava tube - cool hikes and must do if visiting. 
- Drive down to end sea arch. Used Shaka guide 
- Ohelo cafe for dinner - low expectations and food was amazing!! staff was great too. 
- Night time we drove back into the park to See lava !!! must do if there‚Äôs still lava. Check with the rangers. 

Day 7:
- Volcano national park finish the top. Steam vent area 
- Art gallery at the park - cool to stop if you have time. 
- Puna trail.  Rainforest hike to beach with sea turtles. Mainly do if you want to see more turtles
- Rainbow falls - good Hawaiian falls. Pretty quick stop. 
- Akaka falls - $20 two people and parking. This one was cool and worthwhile if you have time. 
- Drove to Hilo on the way back to Volcano to check it out. Didn‚Äôt explore a ton so can‚Äôt provide much feedback here. 
- Ratana‚Äôs green papaya for dinner. Don‚Äôt do it. 
- Nicoco gelato.  Amazing!
- Volcano house in volcano national park for drinks. Saw lava from a distance

1656631172.0,Quick Trip Report (mainly focused on food) Big Island and Maui June 2022,"Just finished up a 6 day on Maui, 5 Day on Big Island Trip.
 

Airlines - SFO was jammed for our 9am flight, looked like the non-tsa pre line was an hour plus.  Even the tsa-pre line was probably 30 minutes.  for our OGG-KOA flight on a Thursday afternoon the line for tsa was also very long, I'd guess an hour or more.  KOA-SFO at 9 am the non tsa-pre line was probably 30-45 minutes.  TSA pre lines at OGG and KOA were non-existent.


Accomodations: 

Andaz Maui 3 nights - Beautiful beach and pool, but grounds are very small, definitely mainly geared towards adults.  Makena Beach which abuts the resort was amazing, and had great snorkeling.  Had ants in the room!


Lahaina Shores Resort 3 Nights - Basic Condos, but serviceable (and free parking)


Hilton Waikoloa Village - Beautiful grounds, the type of resort you think of when you think of a Hawaiian resort.  Lots of kids, beautiful views if you can get an oceanfront room.  Luau was huge, seats 500 people (and had no empty seats).  definitely book in advance for the luaus.  Thought it was just ok, but if you HAVE to do a luau like my wife did then I think this one was fine.  AYCE but food is decent at best, best thing was the coconut jello thing lol.


Activities - The typical stuff, would definitely recommend swinging by Ho'okipa Beach in the late afternoon to check our the turtles, probably saw like 40-50 of them chilling.  Saw some turtles snorkeling early morning on the north side of Kapalua Beach, including 3 all at one time.  Would also say Haleakala at sunset is amazing still, if you don't want to do sunrise.  Manta Ray snorkeling near Kona is as good as advertised, though we had an abnormally good showing we were told.  We used https://www.seaquesthawaii.com/, they took good care of us, including my wife who was scared of being in the dark open ocean.  Got a little seasick, but you're literally a 5 minute ride only from the pier.


Food: Definitely spent way too much on food, but since we weren't coming back anytime soon figured we'd splurge.  Overall, I'd say food in Hawaii is great and reasonably priced, coming from the SF Bay Area.  It can be salty and is often heavy though.  Make reservations months in advance for everything, they were turning away all walk ins at all restaurants.


Tin Roof in Kahului - Ate here twice, the Mochiko chicken over garlic noodles was amazing.


Mama's Fish House - venue is amazing, food was very good but not mindblowing (found the fish to be just as good as Roy's Waikiki).  Worth going to once just to try it out, service was amazing as well.  Wife loved her special (some turducken kinda thing but with fish/shrimp/scallop).  I thought the Mahi Mahi was good but not any better than Roy's. Pricey meal, easily over 250 for 2.  Crab cakes were super fresh.


Merriman's Kapalua - Beautiful view over looking the water, food was just ok for the price.  Has only prix fix menu right now, the rack of lamb was solid as was the ono.  Can instead order 3 apps and 1 dessert off the menu which was a plus.


Lineage - Solid korean fusion food, but nothing amazing.  Reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  Service was great, waiter was very friendly. Had the KFC, szechuan noodles, and beef brisket.  The fried pumpkin in the beef brisket actually was the stand out for me, i usually hate pumpkin but it was cooked perfectly.


Paia Fish Market - Kihei
Had the fish tacos, fried calamari, and cajun snapper.  Snapper was well cooked and tasty, but not memorable compared to other fish on the island.  calamari was superb, interestingly breaded.  fish tacos were decent.


Zippy's loco moco - yum


food trucks near costco on Maui - 
don't remember the exact food trucks, had one that served garlic shrimp which was very good, not as much or as good as giovanni's but hit the spot, and a mahi mahi platter from a small place next to it which was decent.  if you're in the area worth stopping in so everyone can get different things.


island gourmet markets -
can definitely tell its just an upscale ABC store, but the food at these was surprisingly good.  poke was fresh and they gave a lot, and at the waikoloa one they had a kimchi fried rice that came with a slab of pork that was great.  Poke at foodland was a little better but not amazingly so.

kamana kitchen kona-
got tired of all the fusion asian food, wanted something different.  got chicken tikka and palak paneer, both about as good as I could get in the bay area.


hawaiian style cafe hilo - got the kalua hash (i thought just ok) and the chicken cutlet loco moco (more like chicken fried steak) which i thought was delicious.


roy's waikoloa - definitely more run down than its other island counterparts, but prices significantly lower than say merriman's or mama's.  got the mac nut crusted mahi mahi (not as good as in waikiki but still worth) and the butterfish (mmm, just as good).  also got the ribs which were tasty.  everything was kind of lukewarm, not sure why that was. get the chocolate souffle.


maui cookie lab - random roadside shop near big beach (think there are physical shops elsewhere).  cookies for about 3.50 a piece, pretty big and pretty tasty.  was starting to already sell out around 3. 

ALSO if you're interested in those Maui Starbucks mugs look early in your trip, my mom collects them and it was a PITA to find one.  Had to go to three starbucks, and only ended up finding it at the safeway in Lahaina.  Check safeways and targets cause they might have them too.

1656613688.0,Does everyone just wear their bathing suit underneath their clothes all day? And other stupid questions‚Ä¶,"Considering so many folks‚Äô itineraries will involve the beach one way or another, does everyone just wear their bathing suit underneath normal clothes all day?

&#x200B;

Looking to book a last minute Hawaii trip here as my work schedule is giving me 9 days off in a row. I really like hiking, swimming, snorkeling/diving and would maybe rent a surf board or something like that too. Kauai is probably my preference for Islands to check out, and I've already been to Maui but also happen to have some friends who would be in Maui at the same time. I realize that Maui also is going through some really tough times after the fires, and now might not be the best/most respectful time to visit.

&#x200B;

My biggest question, is Kauai fun during the rainy season? the dates I'm looking at would be the 9th of  November to the 15th, which seem to be particularly rainy days just checking out the 10 day forecast. In comparison the other islands look sunny/overcast during these days. When it rains does it pour in Kauai or can you still enjoy the beaches and hiking?

My husband and I are planning to go to Hawaii during fecember with our 7 month old infant for 10 days. I was tasked to plan. 

I can't seem to figure out which island to go to that is also somewhat baby friendly. We want to go hiking but we also want to go the beach and relax. We're not opposed to going to the city and shopping (I hear there's a strip with all designer stuff üëÄ), but we don't want that to be the main focus. 

Overall, I've tried finding sources for which island is good for what but the sites seem to be all to confusing and doesn't really detail the kid friendly part I guess.

But with Hawaiian Airlines it is a truly nightmare, first you can only call in to change, second even if I can see ticket's available on their website, surprise surprise not only the agent can't see the non-stop flight, the prices they saw is also 50% higher than the ""web fare"".

The goal was to see memorable sights and celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday. My mother cannot walk very far and has some medical issues, so I had to keep things at least semi-accessible with easy bathroom access and sitting opportunities.

We flew Southwest and stayed in a rented condo in Lahaina. Breakfast was usually cooked at homebase.

Dinner at Paia Fish Market.
Strolled through the Lahaina Banyan Court.
Went to bed early because we were tired.

Morning: Whale watching tour with Pacific Whale Foundation (tour provided breakfast).
Afternoon: Convenience store musubi and shave Ice for lunch. 
Beach day at Kahekili Beach Park.
Dinner at Honu Oceanside.


- Day 3, Saturday: 
Partial road to Hana. Stopped at Garden of Eden Arboretum > Pua'a Ka'a Falls > Keanae Lookout.

**Impressions**:

- *Food*: The restaurants we ate at certainly came with some sticker shock, but it was worth it! Contrary to some comments here on reddit, Mama‚Äôs Fish House was worth every penny. I was not a fan of Paia Fish Market. The luau food was OK, but I think I got more out of the performances rather than the food itself.

- *Whale watching*: have you ever had a moment where you see/hear something and just want to cry? This was it for me. Although late in the season, we got to see a mother and her calf, and several whales breaching. Would highly recommend!

- *Road to Hana*: Absolutely beautiful! It was worth the trip. I wish I got to see more of the stops, but I suppose that comes with traveling with my parents. My mother had a blast seeing the spots we chose, but was very tired at the end of the day. I would come back and see more with my husband and do more trails!

- *Beaches*: We only went to two beaches, but of the two, Kapalua was definitely my favorite. Gentle waters and easy to float around and look at the fish with my packed swim goggles. 

- *Overall*‚Äîgreat trip! I am excited to come back again in the future. Maybe with just my husband, so we can do more without having to worry about taking care of parents. üòä",VisitingHawaii

I was extremely fortunate to get the last room available for 4 nights in a Courtyard Marriott in Laie, northern part of the island.

[Here's a video of my trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTIfC6RXlOI)

**February 11**

Travel day. I flew about 10 hours direct from Boston (thanks Hawaiian!) and landed in Honolulu at 3:00 pm HST. I picked up my rental car and drove to my hotel on the north shore. I checked in at about 6:00 and decided to just eat and rest after traveling all day.



**February 12**

Being on Boston time, 5 hours ahead, meant I was wide awake and ready to go at 3:00 am. I got in my car and drove to the western coast and hiked to the [pink pillboxes](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/puu-o-hulu?u=i). With dawn still an hour away, in total darkness, I started on the trail at about 6:00 am and made it to the top just in time. I had gorgeous views of the ridge, ocean, and mountains in the distance 360¬∫ while watching the sunrise

After, I went to Pearl Harbor. I chose to skip the Arizona memorial and instead do the Bowfin (submarine) and Missouri (battleship) tours, which were amazing.

After I drove south, disappointed to find that Diamond Head required an advanced registration and Hanauma Bay parking lot was full and everyone being turned away (I didn't find out until later that there's more parking). However, the [Makapu'u Point Lighthouse Trial](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/makapu-u-point-lighthouse-trail?u=i) had plenty of parking and was a fantastic hike. The lighthouse itself is closed off completely, but this light walk definitely can't be missed. As the very eastern tip of the island it provides unforgettable views of the coast and ridge lines leading up into the island.

The super bowl was on, in the meantime, and I was actually able to find a sports bar close by where I caught the last quarter of the game and made friends with a cool group of Hawaiians who gave me free food and beer while we cheered on the chiefs. Right after the chiefs won, fireworks started going off nearby - who knew the chiefs were so popular here?

After I drove back to my hotel for the night

**February 13**

Another early morning, I left at about 4:00 am and drove to Pearl City and began hiking to the [Manoa Falls](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/oahu/manoa-falls-trail?u=i). This hike was kind of mediocre, it doesn't provide any good views and the trail is steep and extremely muddy/slippery. At the end, the falls were beautiful, but the hike exhausting.

Now early afternoon, I decided to take it easy for the rest of the day to avoid pushing my body too much. I drove back north leisurely through the center of the island, stopping and pulling off the road to take pictures and explore. I briefly drove up to Ka'ena Point state park, but turned around and went back to my hotel. I spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing by the pool and reading. At night I went to the [Polynesian Cultural Center](https://polynesia.com/) where I ate some food and explored the whole area



**February 14**

Left my hotel at 6:00 am to go skydiving. This was my second jump and I loved every minute of it. After, since I was already up there, I parked at Ka'ena Point state park and walked all the way to the tip of the point, then back. I drove leisurely back to my hotel, stopping around and exploring Waialua. At night I went to the Polynesian Cultural Center again, ate some unique food, and watched a show. Then went to bed



**February 15**

All day travel day. Woke up, drove to Pearl City and returned my rental car. Uber to the airport, fly to Big Island. Land in Hilo, pick up rental car, drive 2 hours south to Pahoa (should only take 40 minutes but rush hour traffic was awful). I was staying at an airbnb about 20 minutes outside Pahoa, within walking distance of Kehena Black Sand Beach. It was about an hour before sundown, so I walked to the beach to explore it briefly, then went to bed.

**February 16**

A truly unforgettable day, I left my airbnb at 4:00 am and drove 1 hr to Volcanoes National Park. The glow from the ongoing Kƒ´lauea eruption was visible from miles away in the pitch black of night. I parked at the Devastation Trail parking lot and walked in about a mile or so to the lava viewing area, took tons of amazing photos both at night and as the sun was rising. I was EXTREMELY lucky that it wasn't raining and was able to see a stunning view of the eruption, a truly once in a lifetime experience. Once the sun came up, I walked through the lava tunnels, then started the [Kilauea Iki trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/hawaii/hawaii/kilauea-iki-trail-and-crater-rim-trail?u=i). This trail takes you down to the floor of the crater, which was incredible - unfortunately the rain really started to pick up, and I decided to turn back about halfway through. However, I don't think I missed much more as I still got to the very center of the crater, I just chose to retrace my steps rather than hike across the rest of the way and then loop back around.

I lingered at the visitor's center and picked up souvenirs, hoping the rain would let up. I drove up to the steam vents, which were cool, but unfortunately the rain continued, and with lots of fog, the conditions just weren't right and I decided to go back home. Ate some quick dinner and relaxed in my room for the rest of the day

**February 17**

Holy fucking shit, so turns out this eastern part of the big island just gets fucking dumped on by rain for about half the year straight without letting up.

It rained heavily more or less all day, only stopping briefly for about 20 minutes or so. This was my last day, unfortunately, but with flood warnings and strong winds, I chose to just lay low and stay inside all day. I was also pretty tired from being so active the entire week, so it was nice to have a rest day at the end. I drove into Pahoa at night and explored and ate some good food and picked up souvenirs.



**February 18**

Leaving my airbnb at 6:00 am, the weather was *horrible*. Rain pouring down, barely able to see, giant puddles of water on the road, certain road/lane closures, and warnings about flash flooding. I was honestly really scared and drove extremely carefully back to Hilo, luckily making it to the Hilo airport without trouble by 9:00 am. The weather there was so bad, I was worried about getting home; flight delays were already starting, but my flight to Honolulu wasn't until 12:30. The airline, actually, ended up putting me on an earlier flight at the last minute because only a few planes were able to land at the airport, and they wanted to get as many people out as quickly as possible. Hawaiian Airlines is truly amazing. I landed in Honolulu at 12:00, had a 4 hour layover, and flew overnight direct back to Boston. My return flight, quite amazingly, only about 1/4 of the seats were occupied and I snuck into a ""extra comfort"" seat. A lot of others did the same, and other people had an entire set of 4 seats to themselves and lied down flat across them. 10 hour flight home overnight",VisitingHawaii

We don't really eat out much at all because of dietary restrictions.

Couldn't believe costco chickens were still $5.  Some other meats etc are priced the same as the mainland as well.  Food for the whole week for two of us was less than $300 for sure.  Hotel was about $1750.  Rental car $650.

Great weather, virtually no rain, did a ton of stuff every day.  We used the ""ultimate kauai guidebook"" and it helped us plan general things to do and see.  We had friends that lived in kauai suggest some things as well.

I so appreciated the advice of this board while planning our trip and also always got a lot out of reading trip reports. Here is mine from our two-week visit July 21- August 4 - specifically, our first week on the Big Island.

About us: Married couple with a very active six year old son. Love hiking, nature, swimming. Pescatarian and lovers of fresh, healthy food. I‚Äôm also gluten and dairy free. We don‚Äôt like to be on over scheduled on vacation - try to mix in activities with lots of open space to go with the flow.  

About the trip: 10-year wedding anniversary trip (bc of Covid delays, it was closer to 11, but who‚Äôs counting). We had been saving airline miles we‚Äôd gathered through credit card and travel for a few years for this and all of our flights (except inter island) were on miles. Did a vow renewal our first week on BI. We stayed largely at rental houses except where noted. Used National Car Rental. All of these things were booked back in November 2021 so costs, especially for the cars, were not terrible. This allowed us to splurge on some really nice meals and experiences during the trip.

Big Island:

DAY ONE - Arrived at 2pm after a very long day of travel from the east coast including a connection. I was pretty concerned about the toll travel would take with our little guy and us, but it went a lot smoother than I feared, especially on the way there. Rental car was an easy pickup experience.. Drove to Island Naturals to stock up on groceries and prepared foods. This was an excellent stop and while we were exhausted, glad we pushed to do this. Arrive at house (north of Kona, west side, in Puako), unpack and settle, watch a glorious sunset, eat some food and crash at 7:45pm.

DAY TWO - Son up at 4am, not shocking. We head to Mauna Lani resort, as the closest spot nearby open for breakfast. Have a very long lingering buffet breakfast at Halani and promptly fall in love with resort. Hang out on grounds and our son met a similar aged little boy that he ended up playing with a few times throughout the week. After hanging out at our house and relaxing, head to the Mauna Kea luau. This was really nice and while tired, a really fun way to spend our first night. After, saw huge manta rays under the light on the rocks at the resort. Was such an incredible experience - we were quite close - and caused me to feel that I didn‚Äôt need to reserve snorkeling with mantas. Still would love to do that someday, but it was cool to get the experience this way until my next trip.

DAY THREE - Son up at 4:30am. I took him to Mauna Kea beach once it opened for public parking (I think that was 7). Morning adventure to Kona for husband and son to do the Atlantis submarine ride. This was a huge highlight for him. They returned and we traveled east and north to Paniolo Adventures where I had a three-hour horseback ride. This was an absolutely treasured highlight for me. While I did that, son and husband played at the amazing Waimea playground (that I learned about here - thank you!). That evening, special dinner at Canoe House - amazing! One of the best meals we ever had.

DAY FOUR - Son sleeps til 7:30 - yay! Morning hang out at Beach 69 down the road. We loved it there so much for swimming, snorkeling. Lingered for a while. Had lunch at Merriman‚Äôs in Waimea, which was terrific, and son again played in wonderful playground in Waimea. Sunset sail through the boating company connected to Mauna Lani. It was gorgeous and surprisingly not very windy, so it was chill. Simple homemade dinner at home.

DAY FIVE - Late buffet breakfast again at Halani at Mauna Lani resort. Linger for a while. Afterward, hair and makeup for me to get ready for our family photos and vow renewal. While husband and son took a walk nearby. Did vow renewal and photos at Makalawena Beach which was just spectacular. Dinner after again at Canoe House - had originally planned for Manta at Mauna Kea but as you can probably tell we really fell in love with Mauna Lani resort. 

DAY SIX - check out of house and drive via the north coast to Volcano National Park. Went through Waimea again for the playground and some excellent coffee (Waimea coffee co). Stopped in Hilo for lunch - so many excellent vegan juice bars and similar - really enjoyed Loved by the Sun. Got to Volcano House, where we had a crater view room. Met our tour guide for a really wonderful tour of the park through Friends of Hawaii Volcano National Park. Saw the lava tube hike, drove down to the coast, hiked the sulfur trails. Dinner at Volcano house and then bundled up to hike to see the lava (huge hit with my son).

DAY SEVEN - I woke up early and did a sunrise crater hike for about 4 miles while the boys slept - it was totally spectacular. We then drove out, stopped through Hilo again for some excellent smoothies (Booch cafe), juice and amazing chocolate (Hilo Chocolate Co). Stopped at Mauna Kea on the way and drove to Visitors center. It was a totally clear day and we did he small hike to the lookout - very beautiful and even midday pretty cold. Would have loved to see stars at night, but the driving with the six year old just wasn‚Äôt in the cards for this trip. Then drove back for our final night on the Big Island. Originally had booked the Royal Kona but were able to cancel that and instead splurge one one night at Mauna Lani. Very much enjoyed a day and night there, including dinner at Halani with beautiful live Hawaiian music and a Hulu dancing demonstration. 

DAY EIGHT - Buffet breakfast and pool time at the resort and then pack out for flight to Kauai. This process of packing and returning car, flying, took several hours (including an hour flight delay). It really confirmed for me that for me at least, island hopping for a single day or two wouldn‚Äôt really make sense because it takes so much time.

The train is run by the Hawaiian Railway Society. The facility has a gift shop, private parking lot, restrooms and a toy train museum which is free and worth the visit. My family enjoyed the ride a lot as it took around the historical rail route along the beach on one side and mountain on the other side. At the end of the line, they stopped near a small shopping area for an ice cream stop. If you are visiting Honolulu or Waikiki area consider this train ride into your fun list.

1694897059.0,Planning Your Visit on Oahu and Kauai,"My husband and I just returned from two glorious weeks in Hawaii.  We had 7 days on Oahu and 7 on Kauai.  Our package was flights and lodging only booked through Costco Travel.  No regrets on those.

However, we discovered WAY late into the game that most, if not all, prime touristy events need to be booked as much as 3 months out to get your choice of date/time and standard pricing.  Unfortunately, we were at the mercy of the hotel concierge.  While we did enjoy the tours/events they were able to schedule they were premium priced when I looked up the same booking direct.  Plus tip to the concierge for working their magic.  This is all on me so not mad at anyone but want to share the preplanning suggestion so others can benefit.

 Two events we were not able to book in any form on any dates were Oahu Kualoa Ranch (THREE month booking suggested to ensure your date/time/type). This has so many possibilities so we were open to anyway to get there‚Ä¶..NOPE!

The second was Kauai Smith Family Luau.  We even tried the street side hustle to get tix and NOPE.  Again, it was suggested 2-3 month prebook to get date/time desired.

On a good note‚Ä¶.. we were able to book a helicopter tour on Kauai.  Of course we didn‚Äôt get the date/time we wanted so ‚Äúsettled‚Äù and just moved forward. This one worked for our favor‚Ä¶. The original date time we wanted was booked.  The booking we ended with was midafternoon when clouds typically form so our expectations were well in check.  Much to our surprise everything burned off just before our flight and we saw Kauai in all her glory.  Even the pilot said we were very fortunate to see some sight on such a clear day.  Truly magical!  Our tour was through Blue Hawaiian Helicopters and highly recommend Sami for your pilot.

All in all our Hawaiian visit was awesome and memorable.  I‚Äôm sharing our experience as FYI only.  We are home so please no ‚Äúyou shoulda‚Äù unless you‚Äôre suggesting suggestions to others reading my Reddit.",VisitingHawaii

Hello! My fianc√© and I had originally planned to go to Maui for our honeymoon in end September/early October but with the awful fires, we couldn‚Äôt in good conscience continue with that itinerary. Even though we were in Wailea, which hasn‚Äôt been directly impacted, it didn‚Äôt sit right with us to be taking up any space/resources at a time of scarcity so we have pivoted to Kaua‚Äôi. 

We‚Äôre staying in Hanalei Bay. For Maui, I did months of research to figure out where we‚Äôd go, activities etc but don‚Äôt have as much time now - especially being in the last leg of wedding planning.

So I was hoping to get any recs locals have!

Also big hikers and love kayaking so tips on that also appreciated.",VisitingHawaii
1680897572.0,Fine Dining Big Island,"My spouse and I (just the two of us) are heading to the Big Island and O'ahu for our anniversary trip in August this year.

We will celebrate our actual anniversary while we're on the Big Island and we traditionally treat ourselves to a fine dining experience (as opposed to other non-anniversary days when we prefer to frequent small businesses, roadside eateries or cooking for ourselves).

What we're looking for:

* Beach adjacent for the sunset dining
* Locally sourced and sustainable food
* Preferably Hawaiian fare (I did not adventure all the way to Hawaii to eat French or Italian food)
* Live Music (really important)
* Four Star or similar rating (not as important, but preferable)

I *did* do some research and what I've found are Browns Beach House, Merriman's and 'ULU. I know Merriman's isn't beach adjacent, but looks like it has beautiful views. I cannot tell very clearly which venues have live music.

1680252958.0,Lilo & Stitch's Reception,"I've wanted to visit Hawaii since I was little, as I grew up exploring the Destiny Islands in Kingdom Hearts, reading about Junie B. Jones' trip, traveling to Island Delfino in Mario Sunshine, and- of course- watching Lilo & Stitch too many times to count.

However, recently I've come to wonder how the locals really feel about the movie, and I haven't been able to find a ton of info about it from searching.

Like, I'm a big Disney animation nerd, and I was thinking if I finally got to go to Hawaii, I would perhaps have a little Stitch keychain on my backpack to be thematic. (In particular, I have one my BFF brought me back from Japan). I would even love to visit Hanapepe so I could see the inspiration for Lilo's town in person.

1666892442.0,October 2022 Maui and Big Island Trip Report,"Wife and I went for 11 days, split between Maui and the Big Island. Will try to make the report below as TLDR as possible to help people scan for later use.

* Day 1 - Flew into Maui

 * Activities - Picked up rental, got settled into our AirBnb condo in Kehei, then watched the sunset from Kalepolepo Beach Park, very beautiful.

 * Food - Had dinner at Monkeypod, was pretty good. Of course got the maithai. Fish special blew me away.

* Day 2 - Road To Hana

 * Activities - Recommend taking advantage of your jet lag and doing this early in the trip to get the early worm. Hit the arboretum and keanae peninsula on the way up the Haleakala. Did the Piipiiwai Trail, highly recommend wearing sandals and going all the way up to to the falls. As well did the Seven Sacred Pools trail, a bit underwhelming for me. Explored Hana town a bit on the way back. Decided against Black and Red sand beach as well doing the back road. No regrets.

 * Food - Breakfast at Baked on Maui, highly recommend. Picked up banana bread at Sandy's, it's pretty good but it's just banana bread. Dinner at Maui Brewing Company, if you've been to any craft brewery in the mainland it's pretty much the same. Nice space, food was okay. I liked the pineapple mana beer.

* Day 3 - Snorkel
 
 * Activities - Did the Molokini tour with Trilogy. They were a great operator. Snorkeling was great, no turtles in turtle town. Went into Paia and window shopped, loved the town. Ended the night by exploring Foodland in Kiehi, was fun.

 * Food - Breakfast/lunch provided by tour operator, surprisingly good. Tried to do a walk in or bar at Mama's but it was a no go. Ended up at Three's Bar And Grill, food was just okay but their happy hour pricing was great.


* Day 4 - Spa/hike

 * Activities - Drove up to the Montage at Kapalua Bay, and got a couples massage, blew us away. Then spent some time at the pool area. Then continued driving around the north side of the islands. Did the Makamakaole Stream trail, loved it. Once again best done with sandals. I used bedrock and my wife had chacos. Only recommend for active people. Drove back to Kihei as the sun was going down. Drive was 'sort of' sketchy.

 * Food -  Coffee/smoothie at Kraken Coffee, was good but very sweet. Lunch at the Montage, was awful. Dinner was Outrigger Pizza Co, really great food truck pizza.

* Day 5 - Sunrise

 * Activities - Got lucky and snagged some sunrise tickets to Haleakala sunrise. When trying to get them I recommend refreshing the page 5-10 min after 7am as people will drop the purchase. This lottery system is pretty frustrating. Left from Kihei at 3:30am, think this was a good time as we got one of the last parking spots at the top lot. Stayed on top and hiked a bit of Sliding Sands Trail. Highly recommend staying up there and hiking a bit. Went and drove around upcountry a bit. Did lunch tour at O'o farms, fantastic experience. Drove to Hyatt Regency and stayed the night there.

 * Food - Just had some snacks from breakfast. Lunch was O'o Farms tour, was wonderful. Stopped at Leoda's for pie, banana and lime, loved it. Dinner was room service, surprisingly good. Picked up some Maui Wine at a market, very sweet but pineapple wine was something new to try!

* Day 6 - Pool day

 * Activities - Spent all day at Hyatt's pool area. The infinity pool is for sure the ""no kids"" area. Recommend it. All the bird exhibits made us feel odd. 

 * Food - Breakfast at the resort breakfast place, was overpriced and subpar. Lunch was pool service, good for after a handful of drinks. The grotto happy hour is much pricier than the Hyatt residential bar happy hour. Dinner was at Star Noodle, really yummy. 

* Day 7 - Island hop

 * Activities - Flew to Big Island, drove up around the windward side. Many cute small towns. Saw some sights in Hilo. Had an AirBnb in Kalapana. Got there late and settled in.

 * Food - Lunch at The Fish And The Hog in Waimea, coming from TX I'd say it was really good for BBQ. Grabbed Malasadas at Tex's, was delicious, their bathroom is gross. Dinner was some stuff we picked up at the Safeway in Hilo

* Day 8 - Black sand beach

 * Activities - Hung out at the black sand beach in Kalapana. Then relaxed at AirBnb.

 * Food - Breakfast and lunch was groceries we picked up. Dinner was Ning's Thai in Pahoa, best thai tea I've had in my life. Really good food.

* Day 9 - Volcano

 * Activities - Went to the Kalapana market and poked around. Drove up to Volcanoes NP, spent the day hiking. Kilauea Iki Trail was incredible. Thurston Lava Tube was amazing and easy. Sulfur Banks and Steam vents was wonderful. Drove up to Volcano Winery and did a tasting yummy but quite sweet. Then went into the park again for dinner and lava viewing at night. Drove through the night around the south leeward side to our AirBnb in Captain Cook

 * Food - Breakfast was groceries. Lunch was food picked up at Malama Market, the poke was wonderful. Dinner was The Rim in the park, it was pretty meh, but honestly you're their for the views. Volcano Wine was great! Seemed like a hidden treasure.

* Day 10 - Captain Cook

 * Activities - Kayaked and snorkel at Captain Cook monument. Snorkel was great, used kayaks from Bayside Adventures, was easy. Then hung out around Captain cook.

 * Food - Breakfast at Kaya, highly recommend, one of the best chai teas I've had. Got gelato at Gypsea Gelato, was very yummy. Dinner was Lava Rock Pizza, pretty good pizza, great views. 

* Day 11 - Outbound

 * Activities -  Hung out around Captain Cook. Did the Greenwell Farms coffee tour, it was great. Flew out to Maui and then onto LAX then back home. 

 * Food - Breakfast at The Coffee Shack, wonderful meal with great views. The lilikoi cheesecake was life changing. I don't really drink coffee so Greenwell Farms taste was sort of lost on me. Rest of the food was airport fare.

* Summary - Had a great trip. Preferred the Big Island vibe over Maui's however I'm very glad to check off most of my wants to do in Maui. Next time I'd like to visit Kauai and spend more time on the Big Island. Highly recommend getting the GypsyGuide app when driving around. However I'll note there's a lot of duplicate tracks from island to island. Felt I really didn't need to buy the one for the Big Island. Everywhere was beautiful and just spending time in Hawaii was incredible.

1664408136.0,What‚Äôs the deal with dinner reservations?,"So [this recent comment](https://reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/xpo5l9/_/iq7dv0h/?context=1) in a different thread got me wondering about dinner reservations.  

We usually like to wander and pick an interesting or relaxing restaurant, and don‚Äôt mind a 15-30 minute wait, but that‚Äôs our limit. We almost never drink, but don‚Äôt mind sitting at the bar if necessary as long as it‚Äôs not crowded with people standing around us. We‚Äôre fine with inexpensive table service as long as they have decent vegetarian options. We like to eat when we‚Äôre hungry, not when the schedule says to eat.  Restaurants that are booked months in advance year round have no appeal to us. 

But many comments suggest that if you don‚Äôt have dinner reservations, you‚Äôll either be waiting two hours, driving an hour, or settling for fast food. Is that really the case?  

We‚Äôll be in late October, with stays at Waikiki, Poipu, Volcano House, and Kona. Are we going to starve?  If we want one nice restaurant dinner at each location, should we make reservations now?",VisitingHawaii

MAUI

Day 8:
* Flight from Big Island to Maui via Hawaiian airlines 
* Kanapali beach resort - We stayed on the west side of Maui 12ish minutes from Lahaina.¬†
* Lahaina pizza co for dinner. Deep dish. Don‚Äôt take reservations but would definitely recommend! 
* Kohola beer co. ~15 minute walk from downtown Lahaina but would recommend drive. BEST BREWERY we went to in Hawaii. Must go if you‚Äôre into beer. Lahaina haze was solid beer.

Day 9:
* Drift coffee in Lahaina. Mainly went here to get coffee and breakfast before our 9AM whale watching tour. Breakfast sandwich gets free coffee any size.¬†
* Whale watching. Pacific whale tours. Whales are mating this time of year! Would recommend.¬†
* More Lahaina shopping. lots to see and cool shops
* Lahaina sunglass co. Of course you gotta buy Maui Jims while in Maui!! Check it out if you need shades.¬†
* Kapalua coastal trail. More of a walk by the ocean. Super easy. Would recommend only if you need to kill some time.
* Resort relaxation¬†
* Merrimans for dinner. Expensive and must book well in advance. Great meal. Best dessert we had on our trip. Very expensive.

Day 10:
* nakalele blow hole. Easy trail and quick 
* Maui hands to pick up some art we liked. If you‚Äôre into that, would recommend. Multiple locations all over the island.
* Leoda‚Äôs kitchen and pie shop. 10/10 banana cream pie. Sandwiches were great too. MUST hit. Depending on what time you land in Maui, might want to hit on your drive to resort. Line gets long but MUST hit.¬†
* Lahaina pali trail. Worthwhile hike if you have the time. We did in between resort and Kihei AirBnb.¬†Recommend to start early since it gets very hot. 
* Check into Kihei Airbnb
* Maui brewing company - beers and dinner at Kihei location. Super cool venue!
* Early bed for Haleakala sunrise¬†

Day 11:
* Haleakala National park for sunrise. Left Kihei at 3:30AM and arrived 5:15AM. My favorite thing we did in Maui. You‚Äôll need to book a reservation ahead of time. Also will need a national parks pass to get in the park. Sunrise parking has multiple viewing locations. Earlier you show up, better view! Elevation of viewpoint is 10,000 feet above sea level. Drive up is a lot of curves but not terrible but allow plenty of time to drive slowly. About 30 degrees so dress warm!! Bring gloves, hat and beach towels for warmth. I heard others would visit the park for sunset and star gazing.¬†
* Sliding sands hike. We only made it 2.5 miles due to elevation sickness. This is in the Haleakala National park. Long hike but we couldn‚Äôt go far because of the elevation.
* Hosmer natural trail. This is in the park and very short. Super cool!!¬†
* Makawao town for shopping and snacks. If you‚Äôre in the area or have extra time, I‚Äôd recommend hitting this little town. Not a must, but something different.¬†
* Beach near Airbnb
* Kihei shopping - don‚Äôt waste your time.¬†
* Threes bar and grill for dinner. Only apps since great happy hour deal. Alright dinner, nothing special.¬†

Day 12:
* Road to Hana. Left at 5:15AM. Start the Shaka app if you don‚Äôt have a private tour!! Drove from Kihei starting at mile 0. Started from the top and drove straight thru so we started at the Pipiwai trail. Tip: let the locals pass. If you‚Äôre driving, just pull off (if you can) to let locals pass.
* My Tita‚Äôs cafe for great coffee (in Hana town)
* Koki and hamoa beaches. Just a view, didn‚Äôt go in the water. Time to kill since park opens at 9AM. Cool pics¬†
* Pipiwai trail - great hike!! MUST do if you‚Äôre in road to hana. Bamboo forest ending with a waterfall. 
* Seven sacred pools - should hit if you made it to Pipiwai
* Wailoa falls. Huge waterfall. Walked trail to bottom. Extremely short, can see falls from road
* Hana Bay for lunch. We brought our own sandwiches so just chilled here 
* Wai‚Äôanapana state park. Must make reservation in advance. Black sands park. Cool cave and side hike. Definitely hit if you can!
* Coconut blends for vegan ice cream. Cool spot and only hit because we saw it last minute.¬†
* Wailua valley state wayside. Beautiful views of Maui¬†
* Keanae peninsula. nothing special.¬†
* Aunty sandies. People say this is the best banana bread in Maui. Unfortunately, when we got there in the afternoon (1:30 p.m.) they had already sold out.
* 10.5 hour day for road to Hana. Dedicate a full day at minimum.¬†
* Maui brewing again. Love it!
* Coconut fish cafe for dinner. Not worth it.¬†

Day 13:
* Lava Java for coffee and banana bread. Banana bread was from four sisters cafe which was excellent¬†
* Waihe‚Äôe ridge trail hike. MUST do. Parking lot gets full so go early. If you get there and top parking lot is full, just wait it out for someone to leave. Not worth walking from the bottom parking lot. Don‚Äôt leave anything in your car. Heard there‚Äôs been theft.¬†
* Beach¬†
* Paia for shopping. If you go to this area I‚Äôd recommend checking it out.¬†
* Drinks at vana. Only went to kill time.¬†
* Mamas fish house for 7:30 reservation. Holy forking shirt balls!! Best dinner of my life but superrrr $$$$.

Day 14:
* Last minute beach time¬†
* pack up Airbnb
* Kihei cafe for brunch. Super quick and solid food.¬†
* Lahaina for last minute shopping¬†
* Back to Kohola brewing¬†
* Whale watching at scenic view off thruway. Definitely recommend to spend ~30 minutes there. Whales everywhere but far. Bring binoculars.¬†

1655035845.0,Big island (largely Kona side plus one night at volcano) and Kauai (Poipu and Princeville areas) - tips for activities with six year old?,"Hi all! I have been following along this sub for months and crafting a more detailed daily agenda (with ample room to go with the flow and chill) for my little family‚Äôs upcoming trip to BI and Kauai. I plan to post that shortly for any welcome critique and thank so many of you for your posts and responses that have informed all that! 

We‚Äôll be coming in from July 21-august 4, a week on each island, our first time ever to Hawaii (and dream trip). I‚Äôve got a good sense our general outline of plans for each, but I‚Äôm looking for some non-tourist non-guidebook advice for more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things with an extremely active six year old boy who would love nothing more than playing with other kids at an awesome local playground or swimming in a simple public pool or hike that has a cool wow factor for a kid (neat bridges or rocks to climb or similar - doesn‚Äôt have to be the jaw dropping perfect ever view or hike, just simple and cool). 

It‚Äôs just us, his Parents and him, an active and fun loving only child, staying in small houses throughout the trip (and one night on bi at volcano house). He is a very new swimmer and we‚Äôll be extremely limited around ocean swimming (I am lifeguard certified and take the warnings seriously). I‚Äôm also on the hunt for resorts that may allow us to pay for day pool access or him to swim while we linger over lunch or a cocktail, or else town/public pools. 

We are active but also don‚Äôt like being over scheduled and my ideal morning is a long walk or hike, yoga at my house, amazing cold brew, meeting new folks at a local farmers market, some swimming, a lovely sunset and dinner. I‚Äôve got all those types of spots bookmarked and bigger adventures planned throughout (volcano, manta ray, na pali boat, sunset sail, vegan luau, vow renewal). 

Final question: kiddo is obsessed with ferry boats. Are there any you‚Äôre aware of on either island. The more work a day and not special/touristy the better for him!

TLDR: any tips for like best playground? Pool we might be able to pay to use? Bike rental companies that would have an appropriate bike for a six year old (he rides without training wheels or on a tag along with us)? Thanks so much for any sort of more everyday kid-approved suggestions!",VisitingHawaii

1682989263.0,8 Nights in Oahu- April 22 - 30,"Hi Everyone! 

Thought I‚Äôd give a run down of our trip in case its helpful for anyone, and share any learnings or things I would‚Äôve done differently. 

It was just me and my SO traveling from Seattle. We booked flights via. hopper, Hawaiian there and Alaskan back. Hawaiian serves a meal, Alaskan does not if that is important to you. This is our second trip to Hawai‚Äôi. We went to Maui in 2021. 

We stayed at the Queen Kapi‚Äôolani Hotel at the south end of Waikiki. We booked through costco. Overall, happy with the stay there and would stay there again. Be aware its probably a solid 10-15mins from sort of the ‚Äòmain‚Äô food/shopping area but that wasn‚Äôt a huge deal for us. If you are less mobile or just prefer more convenience, would recommend staying around the Outrigger/Moana Surfrider area. 

**Sat, April 22-**
We landed around 11.30am, costco offered a shuttle with the hotel booking, didn‚Äôt make it to the hotel till around 1-1.30p or so. 
Walked around, got some lunch at Maragume Udon (short line around 2-3pm!), then hung out at the beach on the other side of the zoo (Kamaina Beach) for the evening! Be aware a big part of this area is roped of for the monk seal to nest so the beach area was tiny!) Went to Paia fish Market for dinner (we‚Äôd tried this on Maui and enjoyed it! 

**Sun, April 23-**
Took a surfing lesson, it was fun, definitely recommend doing that but won‚Äôt mention where we took the lesson as while I enjoyed it, my experience on Maui was better, but would recommend a surfing lessons from one of the many schools in the area! We went to Liliha bakery for breakfast, recommend the poi mochi donut and the cream puffs! We spent a few hours on Kuhio beach, it was crowded! 
Got a Poke bowl from Maguro Spot for dinner and ice cream from Matcha Stand Maiko. Both highly recommend! We also stopped by Musubi cafe sometime on this day- super recommend it!

**Monday April 24-**
Managed to secure tickets for a 12.20 entry to Hanuma bay on Wed - make sure you are on your phone ready by 6.55am! 
We did Pearl Harbor- USS Arizona Memorial in the morning, we were not able to get tickets (forgot!) but were able to get in on the standby line at 8.15am. Get there early! We also did the submarine tour and museum. Recommend both! We were there till about noon or so and then went to the Bishop Museum. We ubered both placed and then back to the hotel. Probably totaled around $80 or so for uber this day. Used a Groupon for the bishop museum, we spent about 2-3hrs there! Picked up snorkel gear at snorkel bobs and walked past Tonkatsu Tamafuji and put our names down. Hour and a half wait so we walked back to our hotel to change and headed back. This was my favorite meal of the trip and I highly recommend!

**Tues - April 25**
Picked up our Hui in the morning. Did Diamond Head hike at 6am (make reservations in advance!). Headed to Leonards Bakery for malasadas and stopped at Halona Blow hole on the way to 21Degrees estate for a cacao farm tour. It was fun but it dumped rain this entire day. Stopped at bydo-in tenple and made it in time for our 3.15 UTV tour at Kualo Ranch. Headed back to the hotel and got poke again for dinner! 

**Wed - April 26.** 
Picked up our Hui in the morning, headed to Makapu‚Äôu lighthouse. Dumping rain again so headed back to the hotel to change instead of going to the beach like I wanted to :(

Got lunch at our hotel, yummy french toast! 
Headed back out to Hanauma Bay. It was beautiful but still dumping rain so we only spent about 2 hrs there and headed back around 2.30 or so. Showered and then headed to h mart to try Giovanni‚Äôs as we were not going to make it to north shore. Went to Tantulus Lookout and then to check out the Ala Moana center. Got bubble tea at tiger sugar. We went to stix and had cold soba for dinner! 

**Thurs April 27.**
Rained the whole day pretty much. Spent time in the shopping areas :( would recommend saving Bishop museum for a rainy day as no reservations needed. Went to Heavenly for breakfast (french toast again!) and Kona Coffee purveyers for caffeine. Get the black sesame latte and pastry. Tried Yung Yee Kim Dimsum for dinner. I think I‚Äôd skip this, go to Tim Ho Wan instead? Or maybe try the one in Chinatown. 
 
**Fri April 28**
Spent the morning sunbathing. 
Took the waikiki trolley to iolani palace, snagged 12.45 tickets, walked to the pig and the lady for lunch (get the pho french dip, second favorite meal of the trip). Went back to Iolani palace and caught the last trolley back to waikiki. Went to Maguro Brothers for dinner- best poke Ive had, definitely try it! 

**Sat- April 29th**
Last full day. Took it easy, sunbathed and lounged around Waikiki. Got more pastries and fish for dinner! Get the plates at Paia Fish Market. 

**Sun April 30.**
Airport shuttle at 8am. Picked up musubi before! 

Things Id do differently.

I wish i picked an earlier flight home. Got home later than I would‚Äôve liked. 

Saved Bishop Museum for a rainy day. 

Uber to Chinatown/Iolani palace vs using the trolley. 

Maybe used a different rental than hui for cars.

EDIT: I tried to book a tour of Shangri-La too late and wish I‚Äôd booked this earlier! 

Highlights. 

Dont miss tonkatsu and the pig and the lady. 
Kualoa ranch is a must do, also diamond head. 
Loved bishop museum and iolani palace. 
Also Kona coffee purveyers.

1678419346.0,mamas fish house resrvartion,"hi, was reading about how hard it is to get a reservation and wanted to share how I got one . I booked a trip to Maui a couple of months ago and was told to go to Mamas Fish House. When I looked online they had zero reservations available so I called the restaurant and spoke to the host. The host explained that they did not have a waiting list but I could set up an alert on Open table app on my iPhone. So I did this , and I constantly got notifications saying that a reservation had opened up .... however when I went online they were gone .... usually only a few seconds after the notification . At this point Im super discouraged , so I opened up my open table app and started to refresh it every few minutes and could see that reservations were constantly popping up but would disappear in a matter of minutes . Mamas requires a credit card to hold the reservation and if you cancel within 24 hours they charge 50 bucks a head. Since people book these months in advance stuff happens and a lot of reservations open up. I will say I spent about 4 hours 2 days before my trip but I did see a lot of reservations open up for the week I was going and when I saw the time slot that I needed I booked. Also saw a lot of reservations become available the same day a couple of hours before so if you flexible and on open table you have a good chance .. Also, make sure you have a credit card linked to your open table app you will need it to secure the reservation .. Hope this helps :0",VisitingHawaii

1662745489.0,Trip Report - 2 weeks in Big Island/Kauai/HNL,"Aloha!

Since the many that have shared their itineraries have helped us the most I thought I would return the favor and share our own.

We are a backpacking French couple living in Montreal who got a discounted return flight to Honolulu.

We decided we wanted an adventure/beach based trip and opted for Big Island and Kauai with the last day spent in Honolulu before the flight for a pool/souvenir day.

Hopefully this helps someone!

DAY 1 

We arrived in Honolulu late, we had pre booked the Pacific Inn hotel because of the free shuttle service which was useful to us to be able to take our early morning flight to Big Island.

Hotel was fine for that purpose, but that purpose only.

BIG ISLAND

DAY 2 

Early flight to Kona. Pick up rental car. Scout a little bit the area and the possibilities of activities. Eat at the Papa Kona which was quite nice.

Travel to Hilo, sleep at Hilo hostel which we had booked. Hostel itself has a nice vibe. It‚Äôs not much but all amenities were clean.

In the afternoon we went to Richardson Ocean park for a snorkel and a refreshing bath. Great spot.

Dinner at Pineapple island, wonderful local dishes, great poke and local meat plate. Highly recommend if you don‚Äôt mind a 20-30min wait to sit down but we went for a stroll.

DAY 3

We drove up to Waipeo valley. We packed KTA store poke for the picnic lunch. Unfortunately the valley was closed to hikes but we enjoyed the view from the lookout and the ranger directed us to the Polulu valley trail and beach which we very much enjoyed. Stopped for a Malasada on the way at Tex drive in. Huge and cheap!

Went back to Hilo hostel and went back to Pineapple island because there were more dishes we wanted to try (hello coconut crusted ahi!). Had a great cocktail across the street in the Puna chocolate cafe while waiting.

DAY 4

KTA Poke packed again for the road, we headed down south to the Pohoiki bay hot springs. Unfortunately we did not know those springs were destructed by the 2018 eruption (our guide was slightly old), so it was more of a lava devastation discovery than a nice swim. 

We decided to stop at a random beach on the way back which looked like some people were enjoying, and we ended up snorkeling there and randomly part of a school of wild spinner dolphins! Amazing contemplative moment, we made sure to keep our distance like the locals there and enjoyed as much as we could from afar. 

After that we drove up the Mauna Kea for the sunset. Stopped at the visitor center parking and hitchhiked our way to the top (we did not have a 4x4 which was mandatory) Amazing sunset and then lingered a bit around at the visitor center to stargaze until we were too cold. 

Went back to Hilo hostel. 

DAY 5

Finally left the hostel, heading for the Volcano park!

Arrived early to be able to get a camping spot (first come first serve), build up the tent and then headed for the visitor center and met Ranger Steve, a wonderfully passionate person that helped us to build our 2 days there.

We started off by the 2 eruption viewing sites that were accessible easily and met back ranger Steve at 1pm for a 4 hour crater hike up around the Pu‚Äôu huluhulu trail. We felt extremely lucky, that tour was up to 30 people and we ended up being 6. It was a unique experience, Steve shared his love for the island, took us off trail, and told local stories about the volcanos and vegetation. Definitely a highlight.

Went back to the campsite and early to bed tired by the day. 

DAY 6

Got up early and went to do the 7 mile Kilauea-Iki crater trail.

Took half a day. Then we decided that we wanted to rest up at the beach, so we drove to Punalu‚Äôu beach. Had a bit of a nap and snorkel with some turtles. Then headed back to the Volcano House restaurant which we had booked for an evening drink and early diner.

Enjoyed the food though the view was a bit disappointing because of the wet weather. Though tired we decided to do the lava viewing around 9pm, per ranger Steve great advice. It was amazing. The bulk of tourist was gone and the view was dreamlike.

Went back to the camping to sleep.

DAY 7

We departed for Kona early morning.

Stopped to do the Green sand beach trail and had a rest over there enjoying the view and the sand.

The trail roughly 1h walk to go and another to come back but it‚Äôs along the sea so quite windy even though hot. Still quite doable, regardless of what some pick up driver might say to get you to pay for a ride there. I would only pay for that drive if you have mobility problems or kids. 

We left early afternoon and resumed the road to Kona where we checked in at the Kona beach hostel which we had booked there. 

From there we prepped and headed to the Hang loose Manta ray watch by night.

I highly recommend them, they were funny and very nice, and had the most competitive rate for the exact same tour that day.

We took the 6pm option which was amazing because we got a free sunset on the boat for the same price and saw equally as many manta rays as the later 8pm tour. It was a crazy experience, seeing them eat as close as a few inches from our faces was incredible. What a beautiful creature. 

Went back home and dreamt it off.

DAY 8

We hung around the hostel a bit, there was a beach close by where we snorkeled and laid under the sun for a relaxed morning. Had a stop at Broke Da Mouth for an amazing lunch to go that we ate on the Kamakahonu beach and went for a swim after.

We later headed to our next camping Ho‚Äôokena beach camp park (a bit further south than we had anticipated but tit was the only one that had available permit left that day). We had another swim and a wonderful sunset in our tent facing the beach and horizon. Incredible spot though the lack of wind made it quite a warm night to go through. 

DAY 9

TIME FOR KAUAI

Early flight to Lihu‚Äôe so we packed up and headed to the airport.

Out of the airport we took our Kauai rental and drove up north to Anini beach park where we had a camping permit for the night. The spot is great, we met nice people and had another nice snorkel with turtles there. After a nice day we went to buy some supplies at the Princeville food land and enjoyed our food in the park. 

Slept there wonderfully. Highly recommend the spot.

DAY 10

That day we headed up north to Ke‚Äôe Beach. On the way we stopped for Taro donuts at Holy Grail, and holy grail they were good. Personal favorite for the Miso and Black salt one.

Arriving at Ke‚Äôe, unfortunately fully booked weeks in advance we turn back and settled for a swim and snorkel on the free Haena beach which was great already. We then turned back to Hanalei for a look at the beach and met a super nice dude on the beach walking his dog. Turns out he was a surf instructor and we were longing for a lesson by looking at the waves. He opened up his last slot of the day for us and gave us a lesson through his company (Hawaiian surfing adventure - Pono). Amazing lesson, chill vibe like we wanted, and we both got us on first and second try! We loved every minute of it. We‚Äôll worth the 180$ for 2. No idea what the prices around are and honestly do not care because the spontaneity of it all made all money irrelevant at that moment, especially because we had been wanting to do it for a while.

Ended the day on great note.

We didn‚Äôt have a camping prebooked for two that night but found a nice Airbnb last min in princeville (host: Kana), who saved us from a night in the car as the hotel option were all above 400$ the day of.

Went back to Hanalei viewpoint for the breathtaking sunset and had a great evening meal at the Tahiti Lui. Great food options, amazing beef poke and macadamia crusted chicken. 

DAY 11

We woke up happy to have slept in a bed and headed for the Waimea Canyon, but realized massive rain was falling arriving around Lihue. It kind of killed our trailing impulses.

We had a couple of (amazing!) treats at Ko Bakery and planned a plan B there. The owner called his wife who lived at the canyon and told us there was 0 visibility. Plan B: go back to beautiful Hanalei for the day and browse through the sopping village.

Great idea as we both found great souvenir and clothes we love! Had a quick meal at Chicken in a Barrel and headed for a swim in the bay as the skies were clearing.

The stay with our host went so well, he offered us another night which we decided to take and gave up our Lydgate camping reservation. 

Supplied again at Foodland in Princeville and went back to our host place for a quiet night, watching the netflix Pearl Harbour documentary to get ready for Honolulu.

DAY 12

Last day in Kauai!

Secret 25th birthday present for my partner, Jurassic fall/Napoli/Waimea helicopter tour (carbon compensated!) Booked through Island helicopter tour which I can only recommend as they were very nice and welcoming. Loved every min and story told to us. Both had a tear to the eye at some point by the pure views and luck to experience this.

Afternoon spent going up to Waimea Canyon (finally!) to enjoy through the scenic route. Stopped for Waimea shrimp on the way (which was a bit meh to be honest, good shrimp but nothing breathtaking). Enjoyed the coco mochi next door though.

Drove back up to Lydgate camp park for the night.

Probably the worst experience of our trip.

Though supposed to be more expensive (25$ vs the usual 3$) because of better amenities, it turned out to be so dirty and sketchy I much preferred the outdoor showers of Anini than having to shower in that crackhead squat showers. 

There were dodgy people all night long doing god knows what with loud music and shady looks towards us.

No idea where the ¬´¬†park security¬†¬ª was because all we saw was squatters.

We were so happy this was only one night.

DAY 13 

TRAVELLING TO OAHU

Woke up bright and early for the sunrise and the sound of death metal from the same hobos that wouldn‚Äôt go to bed the last night. After one of them try to make contact by repeating the f word in a loop we decided we would pack up early. 

Flew to Honolulu around midday.

Took the 3$ bus 20 - Waikiki beach per a local‚Äôs guidance and headed for the first real hotel treat of our trip: Halepuna hotel. 

Really well received, the price/quality ratio feels really good for that city. We had a king bed added for free and an upgraded room thanks to the Genius Booking status.

Dinner at the Mahina and sun‚Äôs which was incredible price/quality value with a live band.

DAY 14

Sister hotel Halekulani breakfast buffet, which was grand, with a nice view. 

Pool all morning, skipped lunch for a beach walk and shopping in the afternoon. 

Dinner and drinks at the sister hotel House without a key for dinner and Hula show. Really enjoyed it and had the Pork and butterfish Laulau which was probably the best dish of our trip.

Weird to be back into crowds! Glad this was only for a day. But happy to be there.

DAY 15

Last day in Hawaii!

Breakfast at Eggs n things which was quite good.

Late flight back to Canada, enjoyed the pool before heading back to the airport!

1649906968.0,[Kauai] [Big Island] traveling with tweens.,"Hi All,   
I benefited so much from people sharing their itineraries on r/HawaiiVisitors so I thought I would pay it forward and share some info from my family's recent vacation:  
We stayed 4 nights in Kauai and 4 nights on the Big Island. Costco - we didn't need that much food since we were island hopping so we went to the Safeway in Kapa'a. Our family - 2 adults and 2 tweens.

  
Day 1 - Kauai (Princeville, The Cliffs)

* Surf lessons at Hanalei Bay- we spent the whole day here. We hung out where they do the surf lessons on the other side of the pier, where the  waves are more chill. I felt so much gratitude being able to see this place, with the waterfalls in the backdrop. 
* Lunch - love the fruit smoothies and acai bowls at the red shack, next to the market. That was enough to tide us over. We had a lot of snacks with us too.
* Farmers Market on the north end of Hanalei Bay - Waipa's Farmers' Market (Tuesdays only from 2pm - dusk) - this was also pretty magical. Great fruit and was able to stock up for our Kauai leg of the trip. I heard that it is kind of crowded at 2 so waited and went at 3:30/4. The stalls were still well stocked (maybe different in the summer?). There is a stall that sells ginger/passion fruit juice - I highly recommend it!
* Dinner - Kilauea Fish Market. This was a winner. Their fish tacos were solid. Super friendly - my kids really liked this spot, too. Market across the way was lovely too.

Day 2 - Waimea Canyon State Park

* Wailua Falls and Waimea Shaka tour - I had heard about this through the old subreddit and wow - so good! I was worried my kids wouldn't be into it but they were. They especially liked the Hawaiian stories. On the way back - 
* Stopped at Waimea for lunch and shave ice. The poke at Ishihara Market was so good. It got me hooked onto Poke for the rest of the trip.
* Stopped at Hanapepe - heard about the Talk Story bookstore. This was a real gem - this whole little town is a gem. I had been looking for Hawaiian authors and this was the spot to find them. Highly recommend This is Paradise by Kristiana Kahakauwila and House of Many Gods by Kiana Davenport.
* Dinner with friends at Kapa'a. I think in the future, I would prefer to stay here. 

Day 3

* Mostly hung out at the condo and explored the cool hikes on the condo grounds.
* Went back to swim at Hanalei Bay
* Went miniature golfing at Anaina Hou. Beautiful grounds - kids had a lot of fun. 
* Evening at the pool - we ate in Princeville but I wish I had waited for the sausage guy who comes to the condo.

Day 4 - Travel Day to the Big Island. There are no direct flights from Southwest from Lihue to Kona. You have a stop at Honolulu. This was a bummer. It took all day. I learned not to plan it that way in the future. We were pretty hungry when we got into Kona and had a lovely dinner, watching the sunset at the Kona Inn. Worth the splurge.

  
Day 5 - stayed just south of Kona, near Kahalu‚Äôu Beach Park.

* Did the Shaka tours around the island and through Volcanoes. Way too much to see in one day. The Volcanoes Visitor Center is still closed but still has so much cool stuff to explore there. 
* A highlight was the short trail between Kƒ´lauea Iki Trailhead and the Thurston Lava tube. It's short but lovely. Would have liked to hiked down to the crater here if we had more time. 
* Food after 6 between Volcanoes and Kona are few and far in between. We didn't plan this part well. We ate at Shaka Tacos in Captain Cook - this was so good! Pork tacos were a big hit.

Day 6 - snorkeled at Kahalu'u Beach Park, Luau at the Mauna Kea L≈´‚Äòau. Perfect day. It was a great show and the food was good.

  
Day 7 - It was my kid's birthday and we thought it would be fun to experience a resort. 

* We went to the Hilton in Waikoloa. The main kid pool is awesome, with shade and a slide. But otherwise, a lot of stuff was closed or we felt nickeled and dimed. We had never been to a resort before so maybe that's just how it is. Would not do this in the future.
* Went snorkeling at Puako and saw several turtles - a highlight of the trip.

1699962665.0,1 or 2 islands?,"My partner and I are going to Hawaii for the first time in June. We'll have 12 days excluding arrival and departure and we are flying in and out of Honolulu. Our initial plan was to stay on Oahu the whole time, but it's  tempting to go see one other island. 

The only problem is that we are departing from Honolulu so we would have to go back to Oahu. We are traveling from Europe so it's unlikely we'll ever be back. We would be wasting time flying back and forth between 2 islands, but maybe it's worth it? We were thinking Big Island.

 I have no doubt we will be able to fill our days on Oahu, but since we are coming from far away it feels like we should try and squeeze in more sights. We already have 20+ hour flights to get there so we are not trying to move our return flight to another island.

I am currently in the process of planning a trip to Hawaii for myself, my husband, & my best friend. We‚Äôre already set on going to Big Island & Oahu, & have been debating on adding Kaua‚Äôi as well, probably sometime in April. 

My concern though is with mosquitoes. My best friend has a mosquito bite allergy, & each bite from one usually results in 6 inch diameter minimum swelling around it. She‚Äôs able to manage with bug spray & other preventative methods, but if there‚Äôs literal swarms of them, it‚Äôs just going to be an all around bad time for her. I just got back from Maui & my only run in with mosquitoes there was on Hana Road (I forgot to put on bug spray cause I‚Äôd been at the beach resort, my bad), but even then they weren‚Äôt horrible. Certainly not the worst I‚Äôve run into. And I‚Äôve already been told that I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with them on Big Island & Oahu. Just wanting to double check for Kaua‚Äôi before I move forward with planning.

I already know they‚Äôll be there, I‚Äôm just wanting clarification on how bad they really are, as in are other tourists simply exaggerating because they forget humid jungles have bugs? Like are they Everglades bad, or the same as they were in Hana bad? I just want to make sure I have an awesome trip set up for my friend.

1688833213.0,6/24-6/30 Oahu Trip Report,"We spent 4 nights in Maui, then flew to Oahu on Saturday, June 24th. We did the 2:10-2:55 Southwest flight, so we didn‚Äôt rush the morning out of Maui and had plenty of evening time in Oahu.

Once we landed in Oahu, we had a super easy rental car process on the Executive Lot at National. We were able to select a new Toyota Highlander from the lot. We paid right at $300 for the 6 nights. Then we stopped by and picked up the charcuterie box I had pre-ordered from Graze HNL on our way to the resort. We spent all 6 nights at the Disney Aulani resort and loved it!!! If you‚Äôre interested in staying there, I highly recommend renting DVC points. We used David‚Äôs Vacation Rental. 

The day we flew in, we got settled into our room, walked around & explored the resort, then got dinner from the Ulu Cafe and ate in the pool chairs. Our kids (12 and 14 year old girls) spent the rest of the evening in the lazy River, slides, and pools. My husband and I did walk the path around the beach and to the side of the resort to enjoy sunset. That night the girls showered and got ready for bed, so my husband and I ran to Target to get some groceries for the week and bottled water. 

Sunday we spent the entire day at Aulani. We ate breakfast in our room every morning (Pop Tarts, yogurt, etc.) On our resort days we ate lunch in our room or took it down to the pool area (PB&J sandwiches, chips, charcuterie box, etc.) That day we had signed up for a Ukelele class the resort offered, which was really fun. We all four participated. We took pictures with Mickey and Minnie, and just enjoyed the pools and resort areas. That evening we went to casual late dinner at Beach House by 604. 

Monday we had a private circle island tour with Robert from Godspeed Adventures. He was so fun and we saw every side of Oahu. He came highly recommended to us from some friends who had recently used him and I would also highly recommend him! (He took sooooo many pictures throughout the day, including underwater, and with his drone. We received all of the pictures and videos the next day.) He took us to mermaid caves, a hike through the rainforest to ancient Hawai‚Äôian ruins and waterfalls, to watch spinner dolphins play in the water, a catamaran ride in Waikiki, stops on the East side to see a blowhole and to watch the locals body/boogie board surf insane waves on the beach with the highest death/injury list, the Byodo-in Temple, places where lots of films such as 50 First Dates were filmed, the Obama‚Äôs house, snorkeling at Sharks Cove, cliff jumping, a beach known for sea turtles, and our last stop was ice cream on the North Shore. After the tour we relaxed and ate pizza out at the Aulani pools. This was an incredible day!!!

On Tuesday we did surf lessons on the North Shore from 8:30-10:30 with Uncle Bryan‚Äôs. I highly recommend them as well! The girls were naturals and were up from the beginning‚Ä¶mom and dad were decent. We had a photographer for surf lessons that Uncle Bryan‚Äôs had recommended and I am so glad we did.) After surfing, we enjoyed lunch at the food trucks in North Shore‚Ä¶my husband and I loved Camaron‚Äôs. Our guide from Monday recommended them over Giovanni‚Äôs because they peel their shrimp and the sauce actually stays on them. After lunch we went to Waimea Valley. The valley is beautiful with so many different plants and trees. We were also able to swim in Waimea Falls. Next we went to get shave ice at the famous Matsumato‚Äôs, which was so good! 
We ended the day with changing and getting dressed in our car for a luau. The Toa Luau was so fun and we had a wonderful time learning more about the Hawaiian past and culture.

Wednesday was another Aulani resort day for us. The girls rented paddle boards, we walked to the beach in front of Paradise Cove to see the monk seals, enjoyed the pools, and just relaxed. That night we had reservations at Monkeypod Kitchen. Our food was so good and we loved their Mai Tai‚Äôs! 

Thursday we started the day at the Pearl Harbor Memorial. We did have 10:00 Arizona reservations and we arrived at Pearl Harbor a little before 9:00. So many heavy feelings while we visited. The loss is unimaginable, but the Memorial is solemn and peaceful, a beautiful place of remembrance for those who lost their lives in the attack. After Pearl Harbor, we had lunch at Deck, which had an amazing view of Diamond Head. Next, we did some shopping in Waikiki before making a stop at Leonard‚Äôs Bakery for malasadas. We spent the rest of the afternoon/evening back at Aulani for our last night to enjoy the sunset and pools. 

On Friday we slept in, packed up, and headed to the airport. National car return was quick and easy. TSA Pre-Check did not take long, and our 2:25 Southwest flight to Kauai was on time. Next we spent 4 nights in Kauai.

Having the Aulani resort in the middle of our trip was nice. We enjoyed a mix of island days and resort days. With our girls being 12 and 14, they needed the mix.",VisitingHawaii

1673875022.0,Stargazing on Big Island,"Aloha friends!

My wife and I are heading to Hawaii this weekend and will be on Big Island for a few days towards the end of next week. I have read and seen incredible things about stargazing from Mauna Kea, and am curious to hear if locals or Hawaii enthusiasts have any pro tips for us to keep in mind. 

Right now the rough plan is to drive up to the visitors centre an hour or so ahead of sunset so we can find a nice spot to lay a blanket, enjoy a beautiful sunset, and then watch the horizon fill with stars as the night sky comes alive. 

Any suggestions to help make our evening dedicated to stargazing even more spectacular would be super appreciated!!! Even if it's alternate viewing locations. I'd also be curious if folks recommend the stargazing tours or if going it on our own is the recommended option.

Thanks so much in advance!",VisitingHawaii

We are not great swimmers and have not been snorkeling before, but we plan on going on some adventures to expand our horizons. 

**Itinerary**

6/4 Land in Kona @ 6:50. Get a Rental Car. Go to Safeway for a snack if needed. Drive to Hilo. I know this will be tough even though we are coming from AZ. If we aren‚Äôt feeling it, we will consider getting a last-minute hotel in Kona. 

6/5 Hilo: Take in some relaxing sites: Akaka Falls State Park and Hawai‚Äôi Tropical Bioreserve if we are up for both. Maybe go to Hawaiian Style Cafe or Pineapples Hawaiian Fresh Cuisine for dinner. 

6/6 Hilo: HVNP. Drive from Hilo at 3 AM. Depending on how we feel either go to the Devastation Trail Lot and walk to the viewing or Hike the Iki Trail.  I want to go to the Akatsuka Orchid Garden, but it opens at 10 AM. Are there other can‚Äôt-miss things we should do in the park after lava viewing (This is a bucket list thing for me)? Help on this would be appreciated! I would like to get breakfast in Volcano. I would like to go to Moon & Turtle for dinner in Hilo. 

6/7 Hilo: Late morning. Going to Pahoa to eat at Pahoa Fresh Fish, and then drive back up to the Shipman Beach Trailhead for a hike and beach time. 

6/8 Hilo: Hilo Farmer‚Äôs Market. What would be a relaxing thing to do after? Maybe take a drive?

6/9 Traveling from Hilo to Kona: Get settled, maybe find a beach, explore. I would like to go to Suisan Fish Market before we Hilo leave for some Poke. 

6/10 Kona: Big Island Snorkel Tour from Waimea, 7:30 AM. Is there a good place to get lunch up there? I‚Äôve only just booked this today. 

6/11 Kona: Go to one of the National Parks. After maybe a drive or beaches? 

6/12 Kona: Open, but I want to go to the quilt museum. It‚Äôs my birthday and I would like to do something fun.  Any suggestions?

6/13 Kona: Kanaloa Octopus Farm tour, 2 to 3 PM. Can you recommend a breakfast place in Kona?

6/14 Kona: Manta Ray Diving! So excited about this!!! Maybe a National Park before. 

6/15 Kona: Bring back the rental car at 6 PM and depart. Probably do some beaches with showers. Are there any you would recommend?

Some beaches I have found for Kona (we are not great swimmers):

* Kamakahonu Beach aka keiki beach
* Kohanaiki beach park
* Wawaloli Beach Park
* Makalawena beach
* Keiki Ponds
* Alula Beach - Quiet, Sea Turtles

1699663431.0,Recommendations on must visit places in Oahu,"  

Hey folks.

I will be in Oahu for 6 days and am looking to cram as much as possible into my itinerary. I am a big nature lover and thus prefer scenic natural beauty over anything else. 

1) That being said, here's my 6 day itinerary - could you folks please chime in on if anything is worth missing out on in order to accommodate something else you'd like to suggest instead, bearing in mind that I don't drive and will be staying in Waikiki. I am looking for anything that's easily accessible by public transit or Uber and shouldn't take more than 30 mins one way. Also, I don‚Äôt swim. I know, too many conditions lol.

Day 1:

¬∑ Tantalus lookout

¬∑ Pali lookout

¬∑ Ko‚Äôolau Mountains 

¬∑ Waimanalo Bay

¬∑ Makapu‚Äôu Beach lookout 

¬∑ Sandy's Beach Lookout 

¬∑ The Blow Hole 

¬∑ Hawaii Kai 

Day 2:

¬∑ Diamond head hike

¬∑ Magic island photoshoot

Day 3:

¬∑ Whale watching

¬∑ Beach day at Waikiki, shopping for souvenirs

Day 4:

¬∑ Koko Crater Railway Trail

¬∑ Makapu'u Point (repeat from day 1 but it‚Äôs part of the tour, so cannot opt out)

¬∑ Sandy Beach Park (repeat from day 1 but it‚Äôs part of the tour, so cannot opt out)

Day 5:

¬∑ Kualoa Ranch

Day 6:

¬∑ Ho‚Äôomaluhia gardens (or Lyon Arboretum)

2) Is the kokohead hike doable for a novice hiker? If not, given that day 4 is mostly a repeat of day 1, please suggest a moderately challenging hike with stunning views, preferably close to Waikiki.

3) I have never had my photos taken professionally, and thus will be doing a shoot at Magic Island. Is this beach a good option? If not, are there any prettier beaches near Waikiki that I should consider (I love a combo of mountain view + beach, but understand all such places are quite far from Waikiki ‚Äì please let me know if there‚Äôs anything closer).

I am super excited for my trip. Mahalo!

Arrive in Hawaii 11:15am local time

Take Uber to hotel and drop off luggage

Uber/walk/bus to rainbow drive in

Day 4: 
Bus/uber to Hiking trail. Something relatively easy for a beginner with foliage and a large waterfall. Also views of the ocean from above. Does anything matching this criteria exist? So far I‚Äôm looking at Manoa falls or Hanauma Bay. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd have time for both.

I've got ovarian cancer (I'm still in maintenance right now) but I also have severe neuropathy in my feet which limits my ability to walk very far.

What I need to know is how handicap friendly the island is.  Thanks!  


Also, if Kawaii isn't very handicap friendly, which island would you recommend instead?  I haven't excluded going to any of the other islands.

1672871076.0,Maui 12/8 - 12/12,"We (SO and I, from NYC, in our 30s) were in Maui for 4 days, breaking up a longer stay in Oahu (will write that part up later). Island hopping was wasting some time, but we ultimately decided to do it this way due to two immovable reservations (Mama's Fish House, and Fond Chef's Counter only happens on Sundays). Overall we probably liked Oahu better, which offered better everything aside from the beach (ok and whale watching).

We enjoyed----------------------------------------------------------------

Old Lahaina Luau: A great experience, and better (and more) food than expected. Event starts at sunset, goes through several traditional and ""standard"" courses of food, while showing hula. We gained some basic understanding of hula, and followed the written program notes to learn about the folklore presented.

Discover Lanai with Sail Trilogy: Had to get up early (5ish and then drive over), but the trip was worth it. The morning was beautiful. Saw whales and flying fish along the way. Snorkeling on Lanai with the entire beach almost to ourselves (and helpful staff to guide us) was way better than our experiences on Oahu, including Hanauma Bay. Breakfast, lunch, and drinks were offered, but we didn't eat/drink much.

Lahaina Grill: Best food we had on Maui, where every dish was fantastic, including the bread. Standout among them is the seared ahi and foie gras. SO is very picky about both fish and liver, but this one nailed them perfectly. Cracks our all-time top 5 restaurants.

Fond Chef's Counter: Emailed them early to reserve a spot. More of a show/class really. 12 seats around a kitchen counter where Chef Jojo prepares and explains every dish. Very interesting to go through his creative and preparation process. One issue is the food was decent but not mind-blowing - a couple dishes were too greasy and the fish seemed lower quality than what we had at other places of similar price ($140 per).

Foodland Poke: Even cheaper than Foodland Poke on Oahu. Both very very good. Great option to take on trips. Unfortunately we missed how many local places are close on Sunday and Mondays, so we didn't get to compare their Poke with others' (like Tin Roof).

Not impressed by----------------------------------------------------------

Road to Hana: Big Meh for us. Kind of peer-pressured into doing it, though I never had high hopes. Used Shaka Guide and learned how wrong we were on pronunciations. The road was as annoying as advertised. Local drivers were kind, it was the fellow tourist drivers that we came across on our way back that scared us the most. Got reservation to Waianapanapa State Park in advance, but though the place was beautiful, it was so small of a beach that we only spent an hour there and didn't get into the water. We did see many sun-bathing turtles at Ho'okipa Beach, which is right outside Paia and can be accessed without doing the trip. Also missed the turn to Aunty Sandy's Banana Bread, and it was already closed on our way back.

Mama's Fish House: Taken as an ""experience"", Mama's Fish House was something to try at least once on vacation. The decorations and private beach were cool, and we could make out one sea turtle lying there. Purely judged on food though, it was good but hardly worth the reservation hassle or price. The ingredients were all fresh on their own, but didn't really come together into anything memorable. The black pearl dessert was a spectacle to behold, but honestly quite similar to other chocolate desserts we ate at Old Lahaina Luau and Lahaina Grill.

Tour of the Stars, Hyatt Regency: Had to call in to reserve a spot, but... well we saw Jupiter's moons and that was about it. We went around looking through several scopes, and about a dozen stars. Just a very short and forgettable experience. Milky way is apparently not observable in the winter, and light pollution from nearby buildings was also limiting what we can see.

Wailea mall: not a lot of traffic, and not a lot of shops. We had a few hours to kill before flight back to Oahu, so came here to find the Lululemon Hawaii print exclusives. The prints include: shaka, pineapple, and Hawaii islands (which easily gets mistaken for just stains). We found very few styles and sizes left that had the prints, but were told restock happens often.",VisitingHawaii

**Day 4: Travel and Settle in Maui**

* Arrived in Maui ~1:00pm
* Originally planned on Waihee Ridge Trail, but from our first 3 days, knew that we needed a breather. Instead we headed to Sugar Beach ""resort"", where we were staying.
* Sunset dinner reservation at Cafe O'Lei at the Mill House. They asked us if we wanted inside or outside, assuring that the views were beautiful either way. We said we were good with either. Unfortunately we probably were seated at the worst seat in the house--inside right next to a section of wall. No clear view of the valley or sunset. Without the view, the food was well presented, but merely good. **7/10**
* Stopped by grocery store to load up on snacks/drinks on the way back. Prices in Hawaii/Maui are no joke--even with groceries! But you can still save a bundle if you are fine drinking hard seltzers or canned soda instead of drinking out all the time.

**Day 5: Relax!** 

* Another change in plans, as this was going to be our Road to Hana day. I did a ton of research on whether the Road was overrated, too touristy, etc. So it only barely made the itinerary, and given our nonstop pace on Big Island, I nixed it.
* Instead--determined to get that view--I made a last-minute reservation for us back at Cafe O'Lei for lunch. This time we requested outside and got prime seating, along with some yum pork bao and fish and chips. Food was better, views were stunning, and the other places in the walking area were open, so we stopped by the market and enjoyed the gardens. **8.5/10**
* Relaxed by the pool/beach most of the afternoon. Interestingly, the power went out around 7pm in our district--affecting about 4k people. Sat in the darkened room looking out over the flashlit rooms of the resort and walked the extra-dark beach. Made for an unexpected, but enjoyable eve!

**Day 6: Nat'l Park II**

* Our last full day before heading in to Wailea. Unexpected benefit was morning football! With games starting at ~7am, I enjoyed those til about 10 or 11.
* Then we headed up to Haleakala Nat'l Park. Get a year-long Nat'l Park pass if you're hitting up more than just one on your trip!
*Pretty long drive up windy roads and rapid elevation gain. My wife was very uncomfortable with the roads and was worried about the drive down, which hindered the positivity. There were free-roaming cows out very close to the road, which was very novel to me!
* Hit the visitor's center before turning back to do the quick Hosmer's Grove hike (it's a quick left near a campground after you're in the park). This hike was absolutely lovely--everything I want in a hike. It had an interesting story (failed nonindigenous tree grove compared to local species), was bite-sized at ~.6 miles, features several lovely benches to take in views and had a ton of birds everywhere! We were fortunate enough to be the only folks on the trail, so was absolutely serene. **9/10**
* Drove the rest of the way up with increasingly nervous wife. Got to the top around 4pm. Bathrooms and water available. Hiked up the little Pa Ka'oao Trail overlooking the vista and Sliding Sands trail. Hardly a hike (.5 miles up this large hill next to the parking lot), but the views were stunning. **8/10**
* Headed to the tippy top near the observatory at about 5:00. The main lot had filled, so a ranger was directing us to park along the road. We sat in the car for a half hour before ascending to the main sunset-watching part (Red Hill).
* Very cold, although we had all our cold-weather gear on and a blanket. I was again struck by how unprepared many folks were, wearing flip flops and bringing babies and large families around. We grabbed a seat on the curb at the top where there weren't too many folks gathered and watched the show. Pretty cloudy, so the ""sunset"" was mostly watching it get below cloud cover. A lot better sunsets at the beach, so disappointing for all the effort to see it. **4.5/10**
* Headed back to Pa Ka'oao trail area to stargaze. Either due to the elevation or my wife's fear of the road, the daunting journey home eclipsed the pleasure of the stars. Bake in a decent amount of time for the sun to fully set and the stars to arrive in full here. We headed down probably 20-30 minutes after sunset. (seeing the Maui coast all lit up as we descended was stunning though) **6.5/10**

**Day 7: Wailea!**

* Packed up from Sugar Beach with 5 hours til our 4pm check-in at the Andaz.
* Made the exceedingly poor decision to grab Mexican food for lunch. Initial option of Roasted Chiles restaurant was randomly closed that day, so we settled with Amigos. Worst dining experience of the trip. **3/10**
* Stopped by the Shops at Wailea mall area to kill time. Lots of expensive places to spend money.
* Headed to the Andaz around 2pm. No self-park available, but Enterprise rental car return available in the neighboring Wailea Resort. Dropped it off there to avoid any extra fees and since the resort had a courtesy car available for anywhere within about a mile of the resort.
* After the luggage folks unloaded our bags, we checked in. I mentioned in the reservation that it was our two-year delayed honeymoon, had gotten a Hyatt credit card to ensure I had Discoverist status at the resort, and bought the generic suite with credit card points. We were overjoyed to get an upgrade to a walk-out pool suite with our own lounge chairs/lanai area. Let me just take a moment to gush on how amazing this resort was. The aesthetic was modern and stylish. The staff were all kind and helpful (although there were instances where tipping was welcome, no one ever balked at just a dollar or two for those times when we were low on bills). The adults-only pool (called the Tranquility Pool) lived up to the name--didn't see a child while laying there the whole time. The fitness center was top-notch. The included amenities included classes (mixology, smoothie-making), tours (only one we did was a kayak tour), and equipment rentals (we borrowed snorkeling gear once). We adored the entirety of our time at the Andaz.
* Monkeypod reservation for an early dinner (during happy hour!!). Took the resort's courtesy car there. Had an excellent waiter. Enjoyed three discounted mai tais, discounted pizza, and challenged our palette with the pumpkin patch ravioli appetizer. **9.5/10**
* With our buzz on, we bought some average chocolates from a store outside Monkeypod and courtesy car'd back to the resort to explore the grounds.

**Day 8: Resort Life**

* Pool day. Also tried the Peloton bikes included in the fitness center. 
* Dinner reservations at Ka'ana Kitchen, a farm-to-kitchen style restaurant at the resort. The Waipoli Mixed Greens was the single best appetizer we had our entire trip. Just a stunning mix of fruit and veggie flavors including vanilla poached pears, candied pecans, and red-wine mascarpone. After so many meals where we had leftovers due to large portion sizes, my wife and I finally wizened up and started splitting entrees. We split the buttermilk fried chicken (with a Hawaiian twist--pineapple corn bread, green papaya relish, etc.). It was very solid, but just a slight twist on a classic. **8/10**
* The resort put on their twice-weekly luau that night. We chose not to do a luau for the trip (so pricy to do one of the top choices), but were able to basically enjoy the entertainment of this one for free by watching via an overlooking pool deck.

**Day 9: Resort Life**

* Another pool day. I mostly chilled on our shaded, private lanai due to earlier-inflicted sunburns.
* Did the ""Blend & Balance"" smoothie class. Free and included, several couples and a few solos gathered around a private, clean class area in a separate kitchen room area. Us and one of the chefs. She did a great job of letting us try multiple ingredients and samples of the two smoothies we made. **7/10**
* Followed that up right after with a mixology class. Each one throughout the week has a different topic, and (unfortunately for us) this one was tequila/mezcal! The class was a lot of trying different tequilas/mezcals with deep, nuanced explanations of the differences. By the end we made a tequila-based old fashioned with a very fancy type of tequila, and then tried it with different fruit finishes (there was a special word for this, but I forget). Unfortunately at 11am, we were hoping for something a bit lighter. Still, the bartender leading the class was great and the portions were very generous! **8/10**
* Dinner reservations at Ferraro's, down the street at the Four Seasons resort. Courtesy car'd there for a 5:30 dinner. Let them know it was our honeymoon and they gave us the best seat in the house--closest to the water, right next to some stately hedges which really highlighted the view. That view was spectacular, as we stayed til sunset. And the food (we had the bolognaise and house bread) was amazing. Absolutely top tier dining experience. **10/10**
* After dinner we walked along the beach boardwalk which connects several resorts as the last of the sun drained away. Andaz doesn't connect to the boardwalk (I guess to keep it more private?), but the boardwalk links back up to the road and was only an extra 5 or 6 minutes to our stop.

**Day 10: Final full day**

* More of being resort bums.
* Dinner reservation at Lineage (Korean fusion restaurant). It's located in the Shops at Wailea area. We had the garlic noodles and the short rib. Garlic noodles were amazing, although we couldn't finish them all. The short rib meat was a little fatty, but the presentation was excellent and overall tasted good. **7.5/10**

**Day 11: Au revoir!**

* With our trip wrapping up, we lazed as long as we could around the resort, then packed up our belongings. Andaz has an excellent ""Ohana room"" for guests who've checked out. It features lots of seating, a tv, three bathrooms/showers, and lockable lockers to store your belongings. So after check-out they took our luggage and we hefted our backpacks down to that Ohana room to store with easy access.
* We failed to have as much fish as we should have on the vacation, so we opted to go back to Monkeypod for lunch! Walked there from Andaz (30+ minutes and partially uphill--should have gotten a car but builds character, I guess?). The fish and chips at Monkeypod was divine. It can't beat the view of Ferraro's, but we could see a hint of ocean and still felt the sea breeze. Probably the best fish and chips I've ever had in my life. **9.5/10**
* Went back to the Ohana room, changed clothes and layed out by the pool til 3ish. Then showered, changed, repacked our bags and took an Uber to the airport for a redeye.

Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt able to get a good shot of white-tailed tropicbirds and I feel like it‚Äôs going to haunt me if I can‚Äôt get one. White-tailed tropicbirds look like red-tailed tropicbirds except their tail is white (duh) and they have a black V on their body ([see here](https://ebird.org/species/whttro)). The lighthouse is closed to the public until Thursday, so I can‚Äôt go back there for my shot. I‚Äôm looking for another good spot for a picture.

Ideal conditions would be on the North side of the island (or reasonably on the way to the airport), and the vantage point would be above or level with the birds.

For instance, I know there are white-tailed tropicbirds around Queen‚Äôs Bath because I‚Äôve seen like 9 of them during my visit, but they‚Äôre flying above it, which makes it a poor vantage point. The cliffs above Queen‚Äôs Bath would be perfect since they would be level with the birds, but they‚Äôre private property.

I suspect that the cliffs above Rock Quarry beach would be great, but I‚Äôm not sure that there‚Äôs a way to access them.

1st:
 I‚Äôm trying to figure out Pearl Harbor and can‚Äôt decide if we want to do it on our own or which places that are a must see. Obviously want to see the Arizona and Mighty Mo. Not sure on the other like the Aviation Museum, Oklahoma or Bowfin. Do I buy the passport and reserve the Arizona 50+ days out? Is there a tour that you recommend if you took one?

2nd:
Is Kualoa Ranch worth a visit to see where they filmed Jurassic Park? Big fan of the movie, but for those that have been there was it a let down or were you glad you did it. Like to cruise around in an ATV to see the sights where it was filmed but that doesn‚Äôt look like an option that I can find, only a bus type vehicle. 

Other things we have planned is Diamond Head Hike (planning to get to the top as the sun is rising), Waikiki area, and checking out the North Shore. Any other places to see and do with the time we have?

I was fine staying on one island the entire trip, but I have tons of things I want to do and there's only 2 things he asked to do (the parks and USS Missouri/Arizona). He said it doesn't seem worth it to pay $200+ to go but I feel bad considering in all of 10 days, only 1 morning will be an activity he chose. 

He is a veteran so he shouldn't have to pay to enter the national park? We would need round trip tickets for the day, we'd eat lunch and maybe dinner over there depending on how long it takes to see them, and I'm not sure what transportation costs would look like once we get there. You see, we are staying with friends who have cars on Oahu, so we have transportation figured out already for free. 

If anyone has island hopped, was it worth it? On one hand it is alot, but on the other hand we already are spending so much to go to Hawaii, why not spend the additional money to see the National Parks if they are worth it?

1691430100.0,My Trip to Kauai: July & Early August,"Hey, fellow adventurers! After an exhilarating trip to Kauai, I wanted to drop some highlights and recommendations from my experience.

**Na Pali Coast Kayak** 

* We went with Kayak Kauai & the [Polihale to Miloli‚Äôi & Back](https://kayakkauai.com/tours/ocean-kayaking-tours/napali-coast-kayak-tour/) trip.
* This is the slightly shorter 10 mile round trip paddle vs. the traditional ‚Äì [Ha‚Äôena to Polihale](https://kayakkauai.com/tours/ocean-kayaking-tours/copy-of-traditional-na-pali/) 18.6 mile paddle
* Absolutely breathtaking. The bonus of the shorter route was the extra time on the pristine Miloli'i beach. Kudos to our guides for making the trip memorable.

**Tunnels Scuba Diving**

* We completed the [two tank shore dive](https://www.fathomfive.com/certified-shore-dives/tunnels-landing-2-tank-shore-dive/) off tunnels beach
* It was the best dive of my life by far... And thanks to [Fathom Five](https://www.fathomfive.com) dive guides for leading us. 
* The underwater tunnels, although occasionally narrow with overhead coral, added an element of thrill. A word of caution: if tight spaces are not your thing, this might be a challenging experience.

 **Kalalau Trail** 

* We made to the waterfall which was \~8miles round trip. 
* Given the trail's duration and intensity, pack ample water and be prepared for multiple river crossings. Patience is key.

**A Few Food Recommendations** 

* Bar Cuda - Cucumber Salad
* Wishing Well - Cold brew
* Hanalei Poke - Poke

1686754832.0,Are we doing this wrong? 7 days split between Oahu and the Big Island next week.,"My wife and I have never been super-structured tourists. We like to find a base of operations and just see whats out there. Sometimes hostels, sometimes BnBs, sometimes hotels, sometimes staying with friends or even people we meet. We've been all over Europe, South America and the US and that's always been more fun than being tied to a minute-by-minute itinerary and spending thousands to stand in lines to Do The Thing.

Since we are now traveling with kids (daughters, 12 and 9) we wanted to at least be confident we had a places to stay, so we booked the trip through Costco Travel. We're at the Twin Fin Honolulu, then have Hawaii Air to Kona but have to stay in Hilo . I know Kona is preferable to Hilo, but it wasn't an option with Costco and we just wanted it to be easy. We have a rental car though, so we can get around.

We didn't really make any reservations for big, expensive tourist attractions though. The youngest is too young for most snorkeling trips except for a few shore-baed ones, but we have snorkeling gear provided in our package and will be near some great beaches.

We did want to do the USS Arizona Memorial but it was already sold out in April when we booked the trip, so I don't think that'll happen. We can still go to the park though.

My boss also has some good friends there (a pretty well-known local meterologist named Guy Hagi) who's giving us some info about restaurants and sites that are sort of off the beaten path, which is our jam anyway.

Then on the Big Island the main draws are Volcano National Park and stargazing at the visitor's center, and all sorts of local parks, vistas and trails.

Actually, the main draw for all of us is just being in one of the most beautiful places on the planet and hanging by and in the ocean, doing some hiking, eating some great food, seeing some amazing natural wonders, and RELAXING. If we don't zipline or go open water snorkeling, we'll be fine... I think.

We'll just take a long day to go to Waimea Canyon.  


I'd love for you to take a look at what I have below and make any recommendations!  
Close to Princeville:

\- Kalalau Trail (I need to grab permit for this)  
\- Hanakapiai Falls  
\- Limahuli Gardens  
\- Okolehao Trail  
\- Queens bath  


Medium Drive:  
\- Wailua Falls hike  
\- Makauwahi Cave  
\- Poipu Beach/ turtles at night here  


Far Drive- realistically how long will this drive take? about 2hours?  
\- Polihale State park  
\- Waimea Canyon

1659907318.0,Maui Trip Report - Part 2 of 3,"Continuing with our trip report. 2 adults (33F & 33M), staying at the Grand Wailea

Day 4: We spent most of Day 4 at the hotel. We had a light breakfast, hung out at the pool, and had a light poolside snack of humus and chips/salsa. The adult pool was very nice, relaxing, and had plenty of chairs available in the morning. Almost all of the slides were open and the two big slides were a ton of fun. The line for the lava tube slide can get a little long but moves pretty quickly. We also did a refresher for our scuba skills at the dive pool with Dive Wailea (located on property). The dive instructor was very knowledgeable and focused on safety skill practice (lost mask, out of air, weight drop) and buoyancy control. Following our dive refresher, we drove up to Maalaea Harbor for a sunset sail with Trilogy. Paid parking was easy to find ($1/hour) and we had a stunning sunset. The Trilogy service was fantastic - lots of good drinks and a delicious light dinner. 

Day 5: We woke up and each went for a run along the boardwalk/path in Wailea. The boardwalk is well maintained and is right along the beach connecting the resorts and some condo complexes in Wailea. We then went for lunch at Mama‚Äôs Fish House. I was glad I was able to snag reservations 6 months out because it was by far our favorite meal of the trip. Everything we ate was fantastic. For appetizer, we had grilled octopus and fish cheeks. For lunch, we ate the fish curry and the Opah with the mahi preparation (as recommended by our waiter). After lunch (make sure to allocate a couple hours to really enjoy everything), we made the first couple of stops along the Road to Hana. First up was Ho‚Äôokipa Beach Park - no surfers out today but there were a ton (20ish) of sea turtles swimming in the water and resting on the beach. We then drove over to Twin Falls ($10 parking) and hiked up to the falls. After Twin Falls, we drove back to Kahului and did laundry at the Kahului Landromat (Clean, plenty of washers/dryers, $7 to wash and dry a double load).  

Day 6: Day 6 was another early morning as we left for Lanai from Lahaina Harbor at 6:30 am. Parking was about $20 for the day. We went with Trilogy and enjoyed cinnamon rolls, coffee, juice, and breakfast sandwiches on the way over. They have a nice setup on Hulopoe Bay and we enjoyed good snorkeling, neat tide pools, and a delicious lunch up in their pavilion. The crew did a great job ensuring everyone was able to get in/out of the rough surf in able to enjoy the snorkeling. We had a pleasant journey back to Lahaina and even though we weren‚Äôt able to sail much (very little wind), we did get a blue water swim. After returning to Lahaina, we explored the town some and then decided to drive up the coast to the Nakalele blowhole. On our way back we had pizza at Pizza Paradiso (a favorite from our honeymoon 11 years ago).",VisitingHawaii

1655315411.0,February with little kids,"Hi there, 
Our trip to Oahu isn't until next February, but I'm excited and working on our short list of stuff to see/do/eat already üòÖ

This will be our 3rd trip to Oahu, but first time with kids (5 & 1). We'll be staying in Waikiki for 10 nights. We will also be travelling with extended family, but my plan right now is for us to have our own itineraries and if we want to do the same things, we'll do those together, otherwise we'll just meet up later and talk about our day. 
Our previous trips were fairly packed, so this time I'm taking a more laid back approach. We have a few must do items and the rest we'll just see how it goes. 

I'm looking to get some thoughts/tips on these plans with little kids: 

1. Waimea/North Shore. We plan to do Waimea valley in the morning one day, then grab lunch (food truck?), then head to a beach to watch the surfers and play in the sand. If we're already parked at Waimea Valley, should we just walk across to the bay? Is that safe/practical with 2 kids and beach gear? Can anyone recommend other North Shore beaches that have easy-ish parking and washrooms close to the beach? Also what's the mosquito situation like in Waimea valley? Is it dependent on season/rain/time of day? 

2. Ko Olina - we plan to do a beach day at one of the lagoons; we'll head out in the morning, swim at the lagoon, grab lunch nearby then back to Waikiki. What is the best time to head in/out of Waikiki to avoid the worst traffic? 

3. Kailua beach. Where is a good place to eat nearby? Either take out or eat in. 

4. Bishop Museum. We haven't made it here on our previous trips, so this is a must-do for me :) 

5. Makapu'u lighthouse trail. This is very tentative. I've heard it's stroller friendly, but also can be ridiculously hot. If you've done it with kids, how did it go? I'm mostly worried about the 5yo getting too exhausted and needing to be carried or crammed into the stroller with the 1yo.  

6. Waikiki beaches. We'll be staying near Kuhio beach. What other stretches of Waikiki are most kid friendly? (Ie. not rocky, washrooms close by)

7. Group dining. We will have 11 people in our group (6 adults, 5 kids). How hard is it going to be to get a table together in a restaurant? I'm sure for dinner we will have to make reservations, but what about lunch time? Outside of Waikiki is it easier to get a table for a big group? I think we will likely do a lot of order at the counter/take out/food court type eating, but at least once or twice it would be nice to have a sit down meal all together. Where would you recommend for a kid friendly place on the beach that also has great food? (We went to Duke's once and enjoyed the atmosphere but were underwhelmed by the food) 

8. Date night. We are hoping one evening we can leave the kids with our family and my husband and I can have a nice dinner together. Where would you recommend? In Waikiki would be easiest, but a short drive out would be ok too. Priority is great food and great view. Not looking for fine dining, but also nothing too loud/lively... just want to eat some great food and have a good conversation. 

9. Wildlife. We would love for the kids to see some wildlife. Where would we be most likely to see turtles on the beach in Feb? Are there any safe tide pools for the kids to check out? Is it possible/likely to see whales from land? (We aren't really into zoos, but might consider the aquarium.)

10. Volunteering. I've reading a few posts on here about volunteering as a way of giving back to Hawaii. Would there be a volunteer opportunity that we could participate in with our kids? (Or at least the 5yo if family can watch the baby) 

11. General travel/Oahu tips for travelling with kids? Feel free to help a mama out!

1675026220.0,Grand Hyatt Kauai / Regency Waikiki,"Planning to book a family vacation (wife and two toddlers - 5 and 2 year olds) over Christmas and New year‚Äôs Dec 2023. 
Quite a bit of Hyatt points to burn and so far I see availability for the following two properties. 
Grand Hyatt Kauai and Hyatt Regency Waikiki. 

This will be our first time. We don‚Äôt have any must see agenda items on the trip but would like to experience some local things most notably poke and seafood. We also like walking around and soaking in local lifestyle. 

I understand the GH is def more fancier and more resort like and I was sold on it until I read some reviews that the pools are not heated which might be a huge downside for the time we are visiting (Dec end). Are there any walkable restaurants/things to do around GH Kauai? Or mostly confined to the resort? 

Which one would have better experience in terms of just exploring around (with our strollers) and soaking in local cuisines and other things?

Edit: is 4 days in Kauai and 3 in Waikiki doable to get the best of both?",VisitingHawaii
1674114490.0,A couple of questions,"Aloha everyone,

We are a Norwegian couple visiting Hawaii for three weeks. We are currently in Honolulu (not far from Waikiki), and headed to Maui in a week or so. We have a few questions, hopefully someone can help us out!

First of all, we'd really like to get some nice views around the island. We do not have a car in Oahu, so spots/hikes that can be reached fairly easily with public transport would be great. We are both in decent shape, so hikes are not a problem, even if it's a bit ""steep"". Back home we do not have ""skyscrapers"", or tall buildings at all; is there any building that would allow us to take the elevator to the top floor to get some nice views? Maybe someone lives in a high-rise and can let us up? (/s, but not really). 

Second, when we go to Maui, we are planning on renting a camper van or similar vehicle to drive around in, but also sleep in. We are a bit confused when it comes to permits regarding where to park, sleep and even stay in a tent. Could someone help us clear up the practicality around how to proceed with this plan? Any recommendations? 

Finally; why is there so incredibly hard to find a public toilet? Most places either do not have one (even for guests, like in cafes), and none is open to the public. Where do you guys take a piss when you're walking around?

1667984809.0,[Big Island] [Kona] Hidden gem of spot to get some local fruits/coffee directly from a farm,"I'm visiting the Big Island (Kona) for the first time, and we were on our way back from a tour when we saw a small farm stand selling fruits, honey and coffee. You could take whatever you needed and pay via Venmo or put cash in the cashbox.

They have avocados, papayas, honey, coffee, starfruits and a few other local and seasonal things they grow. Amazing produce, and literally the cheapest price I've seen on the island! Fresh 8oz coffee beans were $17, and we had just bought a bag for $30.

I'm sure there are other roadside farmstands that people encounter but this is the one we came by and I wanted to share about them in case someone wants to try fresh local produce directly from a farm and is not sure where to go.

You can also text them at ‚Ä™(808) 374-0090, and the owner was kind enough to bring out some fresh papayas for us when we wanted.

1667629634.0,Big Island Farms Tour review (near Waipi‚Äôo Valley),"We lucked into an hour tour at Big Island Farms today that was absolutely delightful and worth the drive from Kailua-Kona.  Luck in the sense of being the only people on the tour. 

It‚Äôs a small, relatively new farm specializing in organic forest permaculture. Sections are considered permaculture forests because they have large trees such as papaya and coconut shielding smaller, younger plants such as cacao. But there‚Äôs a large variety being grown, along with lovely Mexican sunflowers hedges and bamboo windbreaks.  There was also an ‚Äúeducational‚Äù garden with a variety of traditional Hawaiian food plants. 

The tour began with a small tasting of some herbs and fruit. I don‚Äôt remember the 2 or 3 medicinal herbs, as they were unfamiliar, but very good  to taste (not that I‚Äôm big into medicinal herbs). There was also nasturtium (which is very familiar), and a couple of their own macadamia nuts. But the big winner was their apple banana, which is a wonderful, slightly tart variety.  (If you‚Äôre familiar with sweet bananas, you know that nearly all bananas sold in the US are Cavendish, and that previously it was the Gros Michel, but other varieties of sweet bananas do exist).

We then did the tour exploring their variety of garden sections, seeing some damage from wild pigs, and tasting and smelling some additional products. It was informative seeing Hawaii‚Äôs purple sweet potato and the huge leaves of the taro. I already knew that bananas technically don‚Äôt grow on trees, but didn‚Äôt know they were related to grasses nor that each stem only produced one cluster and then died. We smelled additional plants, such as sassafras roots, orange blossoms, and a tangerine (amazing how distinctive the tangerine was, even though it was a variety that stays green), nibbled on some curry leaves, and tasted the extremely sour (unripe) fruit of a cucumber tree. (At least I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs what he said it was, even though cucumber trees are native to North America and not something that requires Hawaii‚Äôs climate.  The cacao trees were just short saplings, and some of their coffee trees were damaged by a blight combined with pig damage. 

Obviously a one hour farm tour isn‚Äôt for everyone. But if you‚Äôre already in the Waimea or Waipio Valley area, or wish to take a lovely drive, it‚Äôs worth stopping by. The tour was $25/person. Their web site is bigislandfarms.com.",VisitingHawaii
1667093523.0,Oahu Trip report (long): October 5th ‚Äì October 14th (Wedding + Honeymoon),"Hello all! I wanted to write up a summary of a recent trip to Oahu. This sub was helpful when planning our trip, and I found itinerary posts and summary posts particularly helpful. My husband and I spent 10 days on Oahu ‚Äì where the first few days were dedicated to getting ready for and having our wedding, and the remaining time was for the honeymoon. 

We stayed pretty true to our itinerary, and changed it depending on how we felt day to day. There were a lot of restaurants I wanted to try, but ended up not getting to since it was much more convenient going to places within walking distance. Most of the new places we tried we enjoyed and I don‚Äôt regret not getting to some of the ones on my list. 

(As other people have recommended, any time there is an option to put a note when making reservations I second adding what you are celebrating. Many restaurants gave a complementary dessert which was a nice experience.)

If you will be staying in the Waikiki area, ABC stores are everywhere and they are amazing. Very convenient, convenient stores that have almost anything you may need or may have forgotten when packing. 

Wednesday, October 5th

8AM flight from San Diego to Honolulu airport. Due to weather, flight was delayed 3 hours so got in around 2PM. We rented a car through Avis ‚Äì no lines and no issues with rental car. Went straight to hotel to check in. We stayed at a boutique hotel called VIVE Hotel Waikiki. The hotel was very cute and clean and just what we needed for our trip. We were able to order two glasses of champagne with our pre-check in to have as soon as we arrived. We reserved a ‚ÄúJunior Suite‚Äù, which was maybe a little bigger than a standard room at a chain hotel, but there was a walk-in shower, futon, chairs, and desk. 

Met with family and had dinner at the Yard House (sports bar type restaurant). Location was nice and next to a bunch of shops to explore. The food was pretty good considering ‚Äì I tried my first Loco Moco which I enjoyed. A nice place for casual dining.  

Thursday, October 6th 

Had breakfast at the hotel (small buffet style with bread, muffins, fruit, etc.). Met with the wedding company (Weddings of Hawaii) to fine tune plans for ceremony and to finalize wedding license. My mom and I got our nails done while my then fianc√©, dad, and brother went to the Pearl Harbor Museum. (Got manicures and pedicures at Tami-A Nails Salon and would highly recommend if you happen to need either. It‚Äôs a small hole in the wall, but they did a great job). My mom and I got lunch at Dukes since we knew it would be difficult getting a table for dinner. My mom got the chicken BLT and I got Korean Steak Street Tacos ‚Äì both were enjoyed. The atmosphere and service were nice, but the food was not as great as I was expecting since many people recommended the restaurant to me before my trip. We went back to the hotel to relax until dinner. We went to Brick Fire Tavern for some Italian food. My then fianc√© and family got pizza napoletana and I got Sal‚Äôs Bolognese Pappardelle. We all shared cinnamon toast crunch cannolis for dessert. Everything was amazing, so if you are craving Italian food and want somewhere small and casual, I would recommend it. 

Friday, October 7th 

Wedding day! Got up early and walked to Waikiki Beach with my mom to enjoy the view. We tried finding Liliha Bakery for breakfast, but the walking GPS was not helpful and we could not find it. We ended up going to Dukes Lane Market & Eatery and tried sugar malasadas, a pineapple fritter, and a canel√©. The treats were good but not great. The rest of the morning was for getting ready. We used Weddings of Hawaii to coordinate our ceremony and they were fantastic. Everything was organized, and the day went smoothly. We got married on Sandy Beach and went to Heaven's Point for extra pictures. Everyone was very professional and made the intimate day feel special. Instead of a reception, we reserved a private room (Rainbow Room) at The Signature Prime Steak & Seafood. This was a steakhouse on the 36th floor of the Ala Moana Hotel. The food and service were exceptional. Everything was amazing - from drinks, appetizers, main courses, sides, and desserts. I had crab cakes for an appetizer, but was also able to try a shrimp stuffed mushroom ‚Äì both were wonderful. I got medallions of tenderloin with mashed potatoes, and the steak was extraordinary. Lilikoi creme brulee for dessert. Almost everyone commented to say it was the best steak they ever had ‚Äì regardless of which steak was ordered. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the view from the 36th floor was picturesque. If you are looking to celebrate something while in Waikiki, I would recommend this restaurant for sure. It was also nice because we were able to see the Friday fireworks from the window in the private room. 

Saturday, October 8th 

Got up and ran around Ala Wai Canal. It turned out to be right behind our hotel, and in running distance. I had looked up other areas to run, but they would have required me to drive to them and I did not want to have to worry about parking. The paved path / bike trial is just under a 4-mile loop, which was the perfect amount. I was able to run from my hotel to the canal, and back to get a 4-mile run in, in the morning. After getting ready we walked to Hawaiian Aroma Caffe for breakfast. Cute little caf√© with tasty drinks and food. I got the traditional waffles with hot cocoa and I enjoyed it. Dropped my parents off at the airport and then back to the hotel to relax. My husband and I walked around Waikiki and got lunch at Uncle Sharkii for poke. It was fine, but just like any food court poke. Walked around some more and got snacks / toiletries at an ABC store along the way. Met up with some family and got dinner at Cuckoo Coconuts (a tiki bar). I got teriyaki chicken and a virgin pina colada in a pineapple. I did not like the food at all, but my husband and family liked their poke / wings respectively. I personally would not recommend it. Got shave ice and dole whip at Lawson Station. I got the Hawaiian Sunset flavor of shave ice (strawberry, passion fruit, banana), and my husband got the dole whip swirl with pineapple and blue vanilla flavors. Both treats were much better than I was expecting. We walked around and watched a street magic show which was fun.

Sunday, October 9th

North Shore day. Somehow, we slept through our alarm but still managed to be on time for our 7am North Shore Shark Adventures reservation. The tour guide when booking recommended the earlier time since the water is less choppy, and there is less of a chance of weather cancelations. (Side note ‚Äì there is a restroom in the harbor, but there are no doors on the stalls and most of the toilet paper was gone so be warned). We made up a group of about 12, and they split the group into two for the actual cage dive. The boat ride out to the location was nice and the water was beautiful. The tour guides were informative and knowledgeable and they were able to explain everything each step of the way. You could bring your own snorkel, but they had plenty for everyone (even corrective ones for my husband who wears glasses). They broke up the groups into those who wanted to buy a video and those who did not so they only had to use the camera for one dive. We chose to get a video so we did not have to worry about bringing a camera / phone in the water in with us and we could just enjoy watching the sharks. The company does not feed the sharks, and explained that they go to the area that crabbers go, so the sharks are familiar with boats. They also used an empty water bottle on a rope to make splashes in the water so sharks would come up and investigate. I had a great time. The sharks were beautiful and there were several of them. By the end I definitely was feeling a little queasy from the waves and was glad we went at an early time. 

After the sharks, we went to Ted‚Äôs Bakery for breakfast. I got a potato, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich and my husband got bacon, egg and cheese. We both got donuts (‚Äúglazers‚Äù), and I also grabbed an apple Danish for later. The sandwiches were alright, but the baked goods were very enjoyable. After breakfast we went to Ka ªena Point Trail. Parking was right at the beginning of the trail. The views on either side of the trail were beautiful, and it was so nice having mountains on one said and ocean on the other. It was a hot day, and there is no shade on the trial, so we decided not to go all the way to the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù. We had water and wore hats and sunscreen, but we knew we would not have enjoyed the walk back after getting all the way there. We took a lot of pictures along the way for as far as we got, however. 

We then met up with some family staying by Sunset Beach. They of course wanted Ted‚Äôs Bakery for lunch so we ended up having it again. I got the crab and bacon sandwich, which I did not like. I did get a banana smoothy which was delicious. So, if you go, I would stick to their bakery items. 

Since we would pass it on the way back to our hotel, we stopped at the Dole Plantation just to go into their gift shop. The gift shop was very nice and I was able to pick up some souvenirs for myself and others. We also had to get some dole whip. We shared a cup of dole whip with caramel topping, which was yummy. 

By the time we got back to the hotel, showered, and got ready for dinner, we did not want to go anywhere far. We walked to a nearby pizza place, Appetito Craft Pizza & Wine Bar, for pizza. We shared Funghi pizza and portobello fries. Both were delicious. It was a cute little place in walking distance so would recommend if you are looking for something quick and easy.

Polynesian Cultural Center Day! Woke up early to go for another run around the canal, and grabbed a hot cocoa at the Aroma Caffe again. We got ready and drove to the Polynesian Cultural Center. (We had bought the Ali ªi L≈´ ªau package ‚Äì which includes access to the 6 island villages, Ali ªi L≈´ ªau buffet with entertainment, and gold level seating at ""HƒÄ: Breath of Life"" evening show. When booking I had opted out of guided tours so we could wonder and go about each village as we wanted to, but if we were to go again, I would use a guided tour to ensure seeing the different shows at each village, instead of only catching snippets)

We got there around 12:30PM. The very front entrance had a lot of shops and places to buy food before even going into the area that had all the villages. We put our name down at Pounders, a restaurant by the front entrance, and looked around for souvenirs while we waited for a table. My husband and I tried their housemade beverages ‚Äì I tried the mango orange guava juice, and he tried the ginger lime cooler. Both were excellent and refreshing. I got the Huli-Huli Chicken, and my husband got the Surf & Turf Bowl. We both enjoyed our meals ‚Äì but we probably should have gotten smaller dishes to ensure we were hungry for the buffet later.

After lunch we went to the area with the villages. We roamed around and saw parts of different shows and activities. It was fun learning about different cultures of the various islands. For dinner we went to the buffet and show where we had the best virgin Pina Coladas either of us had ever had. The buffet and show were both very enjoyable. After dinner we made our way over to the ""HƒÄ: Breath of Life"" evening show. The show was amazing and it incorporated pieces of everything we saw that day going to each village. I definitely recommend going and seeing it for yourself. 

Tuesday, October 11th 

Beach Day! First thing in the morning (7am sharp) my Husband reserved tickets for Hanauma Bay for Thursday, while I went for a quick run. Breakfast once more at the Aroma Caffe. The plan was to check out the Pillbox Hike and then go to Kailua Beach, but we decided on just a beach day.  Kailua Beach was very calm and not crowded at all. The water was beautiful, but there were no waves. We had a nice time wading in the water and sitting on the beach, but then it began to rain so we went back to Waikiki. Since our hotel was in walking distance of Waikiki Beach, we decided to go there next since the weather was nice and sunny by the time we got back. Waikiki Beach was more crowded, but the waves were so fun. It felt like being in a wave pool. After the beach we went back to the hotel to shower and get ready for dinner. We decided once more to get something in walking distance. We walked to Furusato Sushi, which was a small place that had fantastic sushi. My husband got TAKE (Assorted Nigiri Sushi), and I just ordered salmon, oshinko, and tuna rolls. 

Wednesday, October 12th

Kualoa Ranch Day! We made reservations for the Jurassic Park Zip lining and the 2 hour UTV Tour. This was our first time zip lining and the tour guides were great. The scenery was beautiful, but the zip lines themselves could have been longer. We got lunch at the caf√© in the gift shop and bought souvenirs while waiting for the UTV Tour. The tour was fun and we had 5 stops for sight seeing and pictures along the way. The trails were rocky and windy so my husband had fun driving along. We were able to stop at movie filming sites which was pretty cool. That night we went back to Appetito Craft Pizza & Wine Bar since it was convenient and good. We got Shrimp Ajillo this time, as well as Boquerones Pizza, and Homemade Bolognese with Pappardelle. After we just walked around and did some more shopping. 

Thursday, October 13th 

Last full day in Hawaii. Went for a run in the morning and then we got ready for Hanauma Bay. We had reservations for 8:10am, but we wanted to get there early. They were taking people in regardless of reservation time so we didn‚Äôt have to wait. Had to watch the information video and listen to a talk before heading down to the bay. We rented gear and a locker. The area was absolutely gorgeous and it was so fun snorkeling. We saw a lot of cool fish and had a nice time just swimming around. After the bay, we went back to the hotel and walked to Waikiki Beach for a last time since we were already in our bathing suits. Again, the waves were really fun even though the beach was crowded. I made sure to stop at Musubi Caf√© on the way to get Teriyaki Spam and a plum rice ball for a snack. After showering and getting ready for dinner (in our matching Hawaiian shirt / dress combo), we walked to Basalt for dinner. We shared Duck Empanadas for an appetizer and each had the Seafood Paella. My husband got the Cool Burn for a drink and I tried a Mai Tai. Both were pretty refreshing. The Paella was good but was a little cold. We ordered a Creme Brulee to share, and also got a complimentary Mousse Cake since we had mentioned we were on our honeymoon. The desserts were pretty good as well. Overall, it was a nice little place. After dinner we walked around to look at shops before heading back to the hotel to pack. 

Friday, October 14th 

Last, last day. Got up and grabbed breakfast at the hotel before checking out. Headed to the airport for our 12PM flight. Definitely didn‚Äôt want to leave. 

Overall: This trip was so amazing. Every day was enjoyable and we had such a good time. Everyone was so nice and friendly. Waikiki was a great area to stay because of so many things in walking distance. The car was good to have to drive to our activities, but when back near the hotel it was so relaxing not having to drive to get food / explore / find running spots.

I'm planning on doing quite a bit of Christmas shopping in Hawaii since I'm from Northern California (i.e. SF and Silicon Valley area) where sales tax is higher than Hawaii I believe, so I had a few questions about shopping in Oahu:

\- For larger chain stores such as Apple, are the prices pre-tax comparable to those on the mainland? I'm looking to buy a few Apple products since the tax rate is lower.

\- Does anyone have recs on Oahu for Asian stationary stores (any similar to Kinokuniya or Miniso)? Looking to see if there's any Japanese or other Asian stationary stores local to Hawaii.

\- Similar to the above, does anyone have any thrift store recs on Oahu?

I'm also open to any unique Hawaiian snack store recs, I'll be buying a ton of li hing mui, candy, and Hurricane popcorn for my friends back home.

I have a few recs for malls and stores to visit from browsing r/Hawaii as well, I just wanted to see any other shopping or Christmas gift recs others had in mind for a tourist looking to do most of their Xmas shopping on Oahu.

1653769898.0,13 Day Big Island Itinerary Check,"Hello everyone!

I've been lurking here since the other Hawaiian visitor's subreddit closed while compiling a list of everything I want to do while my husband and I (late 20s) spend \~ 2 weeks on Big Island this fall. I am very much a planner but my husband likes to be more spontaneous so I am trying to leave some days for spontaneity while also having a backup list of things we can do during those empty days if he isn't struck with inspiration (or at least something I can use to fuel his imagination until inspiration strikes).

My husband and I are HUGE foodies. It didn't seem like there was a massive foodie scene there, but please let me know if there's something I haven't listed.

Also, we did get the Shaka Guide to follow on any days we run out of things to do. My husband loves driving through scenic areas so we figured that it would be perfect.

&#x200B;

Day 1: Fly into Kona

Only thing I have planned for this day is to fly in, get the rental car, go to Costco, and then go to the hotel. Our flight lands at 6:30PM and it is a weekday so Costco is open until 8:30PM, but if we don't make it I have a backup time the next day.

&#x200B;

Day 2: Kona

Planning on hitting up Kahalu'u Beach in the morning since it is near our hotel. Also have the morning as our backup Costco Time.

Drive up to Kiholo Bay and visit Queen's Bath

&#x200B;

Day 3: Kona

Kalikala Cuisine for breakfast

Visit Parrots in Paradise Sanctuary (my husband LOVES birds and I refuse to have one so we have to do bird activities everywhere we go)

Big Jake's Island BBQ for lunch

&#x200B;

No plans, be spontaneous or pick things off the list of unplanned activities.

&#x200B;

When we get to Hilo, potentially go to Honomu Goat Dairy

Dinner at Hilo Bay Cafe

&#x200B;

Day 7: Volcano National park

Booked a Fat Tire E-Bike Tour. Depending on how we feel afterwards, may stay in Volcano for food/to continue exploring the park or head back to Hilo and do some of the unplanned Hilo activities.

&#x200B;

Day 8: Hilo - ""spontaneous day""

Ken's House of Pancakes?

Akaka Falls?

Two Ladies Kitchen?

Day 12: Kona

&#x200B;

1652892067.0,Advice needed on a 7 day itinerary,"Hello our family of 4 will be traveling to Oahu in the middle of July and I have the following itinerary tentatively planned and seeking advice.  We are staying at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and will arrive on Saturday and leave a week later on Saturday.  I don't plan on renting a car for entire week but as needed.  I have been waiting on Drive Hui to have their new app out so I can reserve the dates I want but still waiting.  Hopefully soon.  

I have only reserved Ginza Tonkatsu, youngest loves tonkatsu, so far and have not thought about other restaurants that might need reservations.  Recommendations are much appreciated.  Otherwise our plan was to just grab what is around when we are hungry or need a snack.  I do have a google maps plotted with various restaurants that I have seen recommended on this subreddit and other sites but more recommendations are again much appreciated. 

What are good places where we can pick up breakfast on the go at either close to the hotel/Waikiki or in route on excursion days?


Day 1 Sat - 

* Arrive / check in and explore hotel / Waikiki beach
* Dinner at Ginza Bairin Tonkatsu at 5:15PM local time

Day 2 Sun - 

* Diamond Head State Park (will reserve 2 weeks out and uber/lyft)
* Leonards and Waiola
* pool / beach / shop. 

Day 3 Mon -

* rent car
* Blow hole beach/WaimƒÅnalo beach/Kailuai beach.  Cannot decide if we should drive south and visit those area and others or just cut across and go to Kailuai and spend more time there.  Was thinking about Lanikai beach also but don't want to deal with finding parking or walking from Kailuai to it.
* if time allows - Ho‚Äôomaluhia botanical garden (9am - 4pm).
* Byodo-In Temple (830am - 5pm) allocate an hour 
* Jurassic ATV Tour (2 hour tour between 8am - 330pm) 

Day 4 Tues -

* rent car
* Dole Plantation
* North shore - no real plans of where to stop yet
* Waimea valley (botanical and waterfall), Tao Luau (1 pm or 5 pm)

Day 5 Wed -

* rent car? 
* Pearl Harbor (need reservations 7am - 5pm)
* Aloha Swap Meet 8am - 3pm
* maybe downtown/chinatown/Iolani Palace (9am - 4pm) 

Day 6 Thur - 

* Pool / Beach / Shop 

Day 7 Fri - 

* Kaneohe Bay Sandbar Tour.  Morning or Afternoon tour.  
* Relax and enjoy our last night.

I'm so torn, there are 3 of us going to Kauai in June and we're set on doing a helicopter tour. Looking for opinions between two options.

Island Helicopters lands at the Jurassic Park falls, but the doors are on and include up to 6 passengers. That means potential for middle seats and a shared ride.

Ali'i Tours is the opposite, it does not land at the Falls, but has the doors off for clearer views and only fits 3 per helicopter, so it's essentially a private tour. Slightly cheaper too.

got it for 153 anight thru priceline combo 

-car rental thru toru, no issues here either . we got a tacoma. personally i rejected the insurance they try to sell and took my chanches about being in a wreck. obviously i got insurance here at home.

- we did a kayak/hike tour with kayak kauai. worth it.

- visited mostly all beaches. favorite for us hanalei beach. least favorite :tunnels beach because water was rough. badass views tho. 

tried snorkeling at tunnels beach . did see some fish but water was way to rough . i wouldnt suggest it.
- there is turtles at poipu in the evening
 
i do suggest renting chairs and umbrella and boards at those rental places. 


- drove up to the canyon and yea its worth it for the views. 

- as you may know it is expensive to buy groceries ,water ,gas etc. 
 
im going to get hate ,but truth is truth. the food wasnt good . tried mostly all the popular stuff and what not and no bueno and expensive as hell. so dont come expecting better or same level of food that there is in the mainland cause your not gonna get it. best food i had here was at the hotel restaurant called bullshed.

Last time I visited Hawaii we took a proper digital camera with an underwater housing. This was like 13 years ago now and I don't use a camera anymore because well we all have phones. Anyway, the question is - what do you all use/recommend? I've looked at the cases like this one - [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZQVB6Q3/ref=ox\_sc\_act\_title\_1?smid=A3PM3BMG1Q0DLV&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09ZQVB6Q3/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3PM3BMG1Q0DLV&psc=1) but don't know if I should trust it.

I have an iPhone13 Pro which has a rating of IP68 (maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 mins). So there's that but then you also read ""Apple says don't swim with your iPhone.""

Hi! We are at the OGG airport now waiting for our flight to Oahu. We had TSA Pre-Check and were through security in about 10 minutes. Picking up and returning our Executive Aisle National car rental was super easy as well.

We arrived on Tuesday afternoon. Got our car then checked into our AirBNB at Kamaole Sands in Kihei. After getting situation we drove to Foodland for some groceries, dropped those off and had dinner at Moose McGillycuddy‚Äôs for Taco Tuesday. Hawaii is 5 hours behind for us so we crashed early that night.

On Wednesday, we all woke up somewhat early due to jet lag so we got ready and started out for the day.

-Visited Lipoa Point

-Snorkeled Honoloa Bay

-Swam at Fleming Beach

-Lunch and milkshakes at The Burger Shack

-More relaxing beach time at Napili Bay (our girls say this was their favorite beach)

-Dinner at Star Noodle

-Walked around and shopped in the historic district of Lahaina

-Finished the night with shave ice from Ululani‚Äôs and a beautiful sunset.


On Thursday we:

-Started the day with a little shopping at The Shops of Wailea (teen girls wanted Hawaii Lululemon)

-Spent a couple of hours at Big Beach

-Stopped by Makena Cove

-Snorkeled in Ahihi Cove

-Drove through the lava fields

-Watched the surfers and sea turtles at Ho‚Äôokipa Lookout

-Drove to the summit of Haleakala for sunset and stargazing


On Friday we did the Road to Hana. What a beautiful experience as we drove through lots of curves and one lane bridges through waterfalls, lush greenery, and incredible views. We walked through a lava tube, ate fresh banana bread from Aunty Sandy‚Äôs, swam at the black sand beach, watched waves crash through a blowhole, and had dinner at the food trucks in Hana.

If no one has told you about the Road to Hana, it really is a crazy drive. The road can be challenging with all the curves and trying to pass other cars. We decided that we wanted to make the ultimate day of the Road to Hana because when we were almost back to Paia from our day long adventure, my signal came back on my phone to find a text that my husband had left his phone at the food truck in Hana. Yep, we turned around and drove alllllll the way back to Hana. That added two hours in the dark and rain to our drive, but now we can say we did the Road to Hana twice in one day! A huge thank you to Poke Bob‚Äôs for keeping his phone safe and still being there an hour after closing to get it back to us! üôåüèª

1686115520.0,Advice on Driving to Maunakea Visitor Center VS Summit,"Hello. My partner and I are planning a Hawaii trip for this coming september. We'll be on Big Island for 6 nights/ 5 full days, then Maui for another 6 nights/ 5 days.

I was hoping to get the chance to drive to the Mauna Kea summit, and just recently booked a 4x4 rental to be able to do so. However, I'm doing some more research and wondering if going up to the summit will be worth the extra money/ time/ effort VS just going to the visitor center in a 2WD rental. Here are our considerations:

1. The 4x4 rental will end up costing us about $200 more for the duration of the trip (on Big Island), and I don't believe we will need it for anything other than the Maunakea summit drive
2. I've read that the stargazing is actually better at the visitor center compared to the summit because of the oxygen levels
3. I've also read that it's necessary to take an hour or two at the visitor center to adjust to the altitude before continuing to the summit. That means getting to the summit before sunset would eat up a good bit of time in one of our Big Island days, and I'm already planning for a full day at Volcanoes NP + a few tours (snorkeling at Captain Cook + night snorkeling w/ Manta Rays). We could maybe squeeze it in to one of the five days, but want to also make sure to save time to relax on the beaches.
4.  At Maui we plan to spend a day at Haleakala NP and hopefully catch the sunset or sunrise at the summit there. So I'm wondering, if the Haleakala summit sunset is a similar experience to the Maunakea summit, should we just do the Maunakea visitor center and therefor save all the time and money required to get up to the summit?

So currently leaning towards not doing the summit and just doing the visitor center... Please let me know if the summit is actually going to be worth it plus if it would be a unique/ distinct experience from Haleakala in a way that would make the extra $200 and precious time spent getting there all worth it!",VisitingHawaii

Would it make sense to go straight to HVNP & stay 2 nights at a VRBO/Airbnb & then the last 3 nights at Royal Kona? Maybe stop at green sands/South point & black beach on the way the first day, hiking HVNP the next 2 days, & snorkel/relax at a beach the final 2?

My husband and I will be visiting the Big Island next month for a week.  Our hotel is on the Kona side but we have a car and are willing to make a drive (or take a ferry) if the food/activity is highly recommended.  I'd say our priorities are: eating, sightseeing, unique experiences (like seeing volcanoes and stars), farm tours, and good coffee.  Anything that is romantic would be a plus.  We don't mind a hike either.  I can't swim so not interested in snorkeling but am comfortable in anything I can keep my head above water in.

What restaurants/food trucks do you recommend?  We don't eat pork and love seafood (but not picky when it comes to anything else only pork lol)  This is what we're interested in so far:

* Jackie Rey's
* Quinn's Almost By the Sea
* Foster's Kitchen
* Broke Da Mouth
* Merriman's
* Kenichi Pacific

We looked at Canoe House, Huggos, Umeke's and don't think what is on the menu is worth the trip.

Are these conclusions accurate?

Regarding the last one, we'd like to spend 3-4 days at an oceanfront resort with absolutely no predetermined agenda, just a few days to relax in the sun, not having to travel far for food and alcohol, go snorkeling nearby, and enjoy stereotypical Hawaiian experiences like a Lu au etc.

I know the various islands can be quite different in terms of their natural features, topology, weather, and population densities, but do any of these differences impact why someone might choose to book at a resort at one island over another, assuming they don't intend to leave the resort much once they get there?

One resort that has stood out to us (because it's one of the cheaper high end brand name oceanfront resorts in Maui) is The Westin Maui Resort & Spa Ka'anapali. Can anyone speak to their experience at this resort?

1663781909.0,ISO Hawaiian-owned Attractions (+Scuba Diving Cert),"Hi all!

My fast-approaching trip to Florida has been pivoted into a spontaneous trip to Hawaii and I know nothing! The only thing I do know is that I am having a moral dilemma with traveling to Hawaii per the request to stay away from Natives.... Unfortunately, my trip to FL was centered around the goal of completing the open water portion of my scuba certification but the recent hurricanes and tropical storms have put a damper on that, or traveling anywhere southeast of there (including Mexico and Costa Rica).

That said, now it appears Hawaii is the best bet to accomplish our goal of completing the scuba certification plus a much-needed vacation without horrible weather. The caveat is that we have to fly out this Saturday (in 3 days) so plans need to be made quickly and we want to travel as sustainably as possible and support local businesses wherever possible!

The problem is I am not seeing much in terms of scuba diving companies that are native Hawaiian-owned, which I find perplexing.... Does anyone have any suggestions?? Or know why there maybe aren't any/many Hawaiian-owned diving companies out there?

Any other suggestions to make this trip as sustainable as possible is much appreciated! I've found a few good search engines for native-owned businesses which mostly have restaurants and things so I'm not too worried in that department but would love to hear some general suggestions of activities or atypical approaches to traveling to Hawaii. For example, is it better to hire a native guide/transportation company than rent a car? Is it better to take public transit? Are luaus something that are a big contributor to racial disparities or something that pays native Hawaiians well and are seen by the local community as a good thing? (excuse me if I sound very ignorant in this area, it's because I am) Are there any tourist attractions/site-seeing, hotels, guides, transportation, etc. that are more sustainable or a large portion or all of the earnings go back into the native Hawaiian community?

We have 10 days Sept. 24 - Oct. 4 to explore and are open to all suggestions. We are two well-traveled adults in our mid-thirties with careers in wildlife biology. Our biggest travel goals are to see lots of nature and animals and also eat amazing food and drink amazing drinks!

From my previous post, it sounded like we should plan for about a half-day here (though I've read some people say they could spend a whole day here).  My question has to do with the road to the park and how backed up the lines will likely be.  I just want to make sure I have a good plan for the visit and determine what time we should be getting there.  For this part of our trip, we will be staying in Punaluu next to black sand beach, so we'll be driving up Hwy 11.  I will have the parking pass purchased online before we arrive and we will be visiting the park at the end of June.  Our plan is to visit the park during the day to learn/see what all we can, then return at night after dark to view the lava (if it's visible).  I also considered heading into Hilo area in the morning and visiting Volcano National Park in the late afternoon and just sticking around until it's dark.  Not sure what is best.  We could also do morning in the park, drive towards Hilo in the afternoon, then hit VNP again at night on the way back.

1.) Does Highway 11 get backed up?  If so, what time do lines start forming and does this stop traffic getting through to Hilo?  Is there a better way to enter the park than another?

2.) How long do the lines to get into the actual park get?

3.) What time would you recommend getting to the park during the day time portion of our visit?  

4.) What time would you recommend getting to the park for night time lava viewing?  Is it very busy at night and is there a better time to visit when it's dark?

5.) Is there a recommended parking/viewing location for viewing the lava at night?

We‚Äôre wrapping up our first trip to Kauai today, and it‚Äôs probably one of the few times we‚Äôll be able to visit in our lifetimes. We had an absolutely wonderful visit. It truly is a tropical paradise. All that being said, I feel like we whiffed pretty badly when it came to the food. We did some meal prep so we didn‚Äôt eat out every meal. However, when we did get out, we had pretty poor overall experiences. The customer service in many of the restaurants was pretty poor relative to the other customer services we received throughout the trip. Maybe it was just a bad week? 

We also found that restaurants and food trucks were open at seemingly odd times. For instance, the food trucks were mainly opened from 12-5. Most places were closed on the weekend. Can somebody help me understand why things were closed during odd days/hours? Is it just a cultural thing for the island? I‚Äôm not asking to be condescending.

Currently, I've narrowed down our options:

**1) The Signature:** The food here looks incredibly appetizing, although the city view might not be as stunning as we'd prefer.

**2) Roy's:** The food has caught our eye, although it's worth mentioning that it's a chain and lacks a view.

**3) Stripsteak:** We're tempted by the cool vibes and the $50 off $150 coupon (budget isn‚Äôt really a concern but I do enjoy a savings). However, the food seems to be slightly overshadowed by other options.

**4) Aoki:** A5 wagyu prepared Benihana style is intriguing, but is it enough?

1696864939.0,Big Island manta night snorkel in February (with kids),"TLDR: concerned about taking little kids on night snorkeling with mantas due to lack of ocean water experience, especially in February when waves could be choppier.

‚Äî

My spouse and I are experienced divers / snorkelers / open water swimmers. We have 2 kiddos (5, 7) who can swim in the pool, float on their backs, are generally comfortable around open lakes but have limited open ocean experience (waves).

We are visiting end of February / start of March 2024, which as I understand is winter-ish conditions on the Big Island. The kiddos really want to join a night manta snorkel tour after we watched some YouTube videos on it. However with potentially choppier seas and slightly lower water temps, I‚Äôm concerned about them getting chilled floating around for 30-60‚Äô as well as them not being a good fit for this type of activity. I did call a few tour operators and they all seemed to say it should be ok, but since my youngest is 5 (minimum age) I am being a little more cautious and seeking additional opinions here. 

To potentially counter some of my concerns, I could get them to the local pool and have lots of practice time with snorkels, and spend a little time the first couple days in Kona with 3mm wetsuits to see how they feel.

1692453649.0,"Maui and Big Island trip recap for 2 people for 11 nights (thoughts, cost breakdown, and sample itinerary)","Overall Maui thoughts: We planned 5 days for Maui but only spent 2.5 days here due to the fires. We got to experience Road to Hana without traffic but i am genuinely surprised at how run down and unsafe RTH is. Highlights for me was the free hula show at Wailea mall and the Kihei Canoe club. Shout out to Hana food trucks. *Could not see Haleakala due to fires*. I am grateful we were safe and not affected by the fires and very saddened for the citizens of Maui.

Overall thoughts on Big Island:
Big Island is awesome but we were tired of the driving in the final few days. My highlights were the turtle beach, manta ray snorkeling, and Mauna Kea sunset & stargazing. We only meant to spend 6 days on this island but stayed 8.5 days due to leaving Maui early. I think 6-7 days is adequate to explore big island while having enough beach and downtime. Food was very hit or miss. I think one day in Volcanoes National Park is sufficient - I would only stay the night to save on driving energy. Many of the hikes/paths are flat with minimal tree cover.

COST BREAKDOWN ESTIMATE (prices in Canadian dollars, reduce by 30% to convert to USD pricing) 

1) Accommodation total $2500 (Maui 3 nights $915, Big island 8 nights $1600)

2) Food Total $772 (groceries $200, Restaurants $572)

3) Car rental $967 (Maui rental $270 , Big island rental $577, gas cost $120)

4) Activities Total $658 (Black sand beach $26, Palace Entry $30, Snorkel shoe rental $7, Kihei Canoe Club $60 x 2 people, Manta rays $200 x 2 people, Annual Hawaii Tri-Parks pass $75)

**Total: ~$5000 CAD not including flights and souvenirs**

money savers:
- Staying at places with laundry and kitchen
- Free cooler, beach chairs and snorkel gear from the accommodations
- Airbnb was much more affordable than hotels when we booked. We stayed at a few cabins/tiny homes and most of them had the host living apart but on the property.

1692372295.0,Solo female camping on Kauai,"I had an expiring flight credit and booked 3 weeks on Kauai in January 2024. I visited for a week a couple years ago, also solo in January, and it just wasn't enough. This go around, it appears that the only island hostel has been closed for at least a year - I reached out and they still don't have a reopening date - and there is only 1 car camping option, my back up, and they only allow 7 day stays. Of course, Airbnb and hotels are cost prohibitive for more than a day or so for me. I definitely booked this on the fly and didn't do my research ahead of time like I do for solo trips but I couldn't let the credit go to waste!

Does anyone have experience tent camping as a solo woman on Kauai? I guess I'm a bit worried that on such a small island, that amount of time tent camping might leave me pretty vulnerable to shady folks keeping their eyes out for prey. I'd definitely take advantage of the 7 days at the car camping spot and probably a couple of nights indoors to splurge, so we're looking at just under 2 weeks moving around the various allowable tent camping sites.

I can provide much more specifics if needed, but all of us are athletically capable so that is also not an issue.

1686791976.0,"Maui, Kauai, Oahu - 4/20 - 1/5","My partner (M, 31) and I (F, 28)  were in Hawaii for 11 days. This was our first time, and we decided to do multiple islands since we don't plan on being there again any time soon. Also, we are vegetarians. 

We had a lot of fun on the trip and also had fun planning it all out. Since we used this subreddit so much, we thought it might be nice to leave our trip itinerary here and someone may find it helpful. Our general impressions were that we liked Maui the most overall. Food, shopping, and beaches were great in Oahu, and we were in Kauai for the NaPali coast - we saw it by land, water, and air.  NaPali was truly a dream come true. 


Day 0 -  Landed in Maui. MSP-LAX-Maui. Our initial flight was on United MSP-DEN-OGG but United canceled our MSP-DEN flight and we had to scramble to get a last-minute change, but we made it to Maui without losing any days - we landed at 8 pm instead of 3 pm on 4/20. We rented our car from National (Civic), picked up groceries along the way, and drove to our BnB in Paia. 

Day 1 - We left at 6:30 am for RTH. We had reservations for Wai'anapanapa State Park for 7-10 am as well as for 10 am - 12 noon. We drove non-stop until we got there around 8:30 am. We ate our packed breakfast and chilled at the beach. We hit the Coast trail (north side), took a ton of pictures, sat, and admired the black rocks amidst the greenery and the blue ocean. We returned back to our car around 11 am. We drove past the town of Hana to Wailua Falls, and then made our way back to Hana for lunch at Thai food by Pranee. We shared a Thai tea and one pineapple fried rice between the two of us. On our way back we stopped at Kaihalulu beach, Pua'a Ka'a State Wayside, and jumped into the falls, got a banana bread at the halfway to Hana stand, and Twin falls (we jumped into 2 out of the three falls there). All of the waterfalls we went into were super nice and refreshing. We got back to our BnB around 5 pm, checked out a few of the shops in Paia and cooked at our BnB that night. The leftovers were lunch for the next day. 

Day 2 - We are both non-swimmers and have never snorkeled before. We booked for a snorkeling tour with Zephyr Adventures Maui and saw close to 12 turtles on our 1 hour long guided snorkeling tour near turtle town. We entered from the Makena landing area. This was at 8:30 am in the morning and by 10:30 we were all done. We headed back to Paia, showered, and had our leftovers from the previous night for lunch. We drove to the North shore of Maui ( we did the stretch counter clock-wise starting from Paia and ending in Lahaina) - saw the olivine pools, stopped at Karen Lei's gallery and got some art for our home, went down to the Nakalele blow hole, and took several other stops along the way. It was just so scenic and pretty all along! The road, I thought, was more difficult to drive than even RTH but my husband has a lot of practice and expertise in navigating really small and curvy roads and enjoyed driving here. Having gained experience the previous day, we snorkeled (with the equipment we brought with us) in Honolua Bay. We saw several schools of fish and a turtle too! We were hungry after this and stopped at Miss Arepa, we shared a jackfruit arepa and a passionfruit/mint drink. We watched the sunset at the Kaanapali beach before heading back to our bnb and making ourselves a good dinner. 

Day 3 - We had a slightly late start around 8:30 am, and drove along the south shore of Maui, and via the backroads to the Kipahulu area of Haleakala national park. The drive was very picturesque except for the last few miles (which were dirt roads, the views were still incredible though in several places). We weren't the only car there, we had at least 3-4 cars ahead of us and a few more behind us. We did the Pipiwai trail to the Waimoku Falls, Ohe'o Gulch etc. We packed ourselves a burrito from the previous night's meal and ate it after the hike. We decided that the RTH and the waterfalls were very refreshing and that it would make sense to drive back to Paia via RTH instead of the back roads of Haleakala. We jumped into the Pua'a Ka'a waterfalls once again along the way to cool off. On our way back we stopped at the Ho'okipa beach, saw plenty of surfers, and turtles chilling on the beach. We spent maybe an hour or so there and headed back to our BnB around 6 pm. 

Day 4 - We woke up at 2 am and hit the road at 3 am for Haleakala sunrise. We got there well in time to see the milky way during the blue hour before sunrise. The sunrise was spectacular and well worth the effort to get up so early.  After sunrise, we hiked the sliding sands trail (we turned around roughly at the 2 miles mark), and headed back to our BnB. We had breakfast in Paia, showered, and left for the airport. We returned our car and took our inter-island Hawaiian Airlines flight that was scheduled for 3:00  pm but instead took off only at 4:15 pm to Kauai. We picked up our rental car and drove to our BnB in Kapa'a. We had our dinner at Tiki Tacos in Kapa'a. The tacos were absolutely delicious and they had several vegetarian options, they even made us a vegetarian version of the Royal Hawaiian taco. 

Day 5 - We chilled at the Lydgate beach in the morning, had lunch at Anatta's Thai food truck, and took the doors-off helicopter ride with Mauna Loa helicopters. Words can't describe how awesome it was. While most people say that you should take the ride whenever it's most convenient for you, The NaPali coast is truly spectacular in the afternoon as the sun really lights up the coast. There is more cloud cover on the other parts of the island such as Mt Wai‚Äôaleale but if seeing the coast in all its glory is what you are after then choosing an afternoon ride works better. We went to Poipu Beach after that and spent time there until after sunset. We came home and cooked dinner. 

Day 6 - We had breakfast and left for Haena state park. We made reservations in advance for the parking spot. We did the first 2 miles of the Kalalau trail, spent some time at the Hanakapiai beach and made our way back. We snorkeled at the ke'e beach and headed back to our BnB around 5 pm. We showered and went to get dinner. This was my birthday day, and my husband made a reservation at The plantation house by Gaylords for a special meal. It was a lovely evening, with fantastic food and a lovely ambiance! 

Day 7 - We checked out of our BnB early (at 6 am), and headed to Kekaha beach for our adventure trip with Blue Ocean Adventures. It was a ridge hull inflatable boat with 14 passengers. We had a ton of fun with several thrilling maneuvers, sea cave exploration, jumping into the ocean several times, and fresh pineapples and drinks. And not to mention the most amazing views of the NaPali coast. We also had the opportunity to jump out of the boat right in front of the NaPali and our captain and co-captain took pictures of us doing that. The boat tour ended at 12:30 pm. We drove around Waimea canyon state park, and around 2:30 pm we left for the airport. We returned the car and took our flight to Oahu via Southwest at 6:15 pm. We took an Uber to our BnB in the Waikiki area near the Ala Moana mall

Day 8 - We decided to use public transport on Oahu for 3 out of our 4 days there. We had breakfast at our BnB and took the bus to the Pearl Harbor site. We spent more than 4 hours visiting the USS Arizona, the aviation museum etc. In the evening, we took the bus to Tane Vegan Izakaya where I had made reservations in advance and this was by far the best ever Japanese food we have had. 

Day 9 - We had breakfast at Waffles and Berries in Waikiki and they had the best acai bowls and waffles I have ever had. We took the bus to go to Byodo-In temple and we loved the ride back and forth, as well as the time we spent there. We had Leonard's malasadas on our way back. We went around the Ala Moana Mall, did some shopping, grabbed some coffee, and watched the sunset from the Ala Moana beach park. We were back at the BnB for dinner.

Day 10 - We had booked the UTV raptor tour at the Kualoa ranch, we took a bus there, did the tour, went to the macadamia nut farm, and grabbed some coffee roasted with mac nut, and some roasted macadamia nuts. We got back around the evening and just chilled at the Waikiki beach. We grabbed cocktails and dinner at Duke's.


Day 11- We rented a car and got upgraded to a convertible (which was nice, since we had the car for only one day, and it allowed us to see for ourselves what the convertibles were all about!). We explored the north shore starting with the Makapu'u lighthouse trail, Ho'omalhuia botanical gardens, Nu'uanu pali lookout, Manoa chocolate factory, grabbed lunch at Ganesh Dosa, stopped by at the Polynesian cultural center just for some ice cream (we didn't buy tickets to go in), and checked out several beaches along the north shore and ended the evening looking at all the surfers and catching the sunset at the sunset beach park. We got back to the airport, returned the car, and caught out flight back to the mainland US at 10:30 pm. 

Final thoughts: Having early morning activities made our inter-island travel day more fun and we didn‚Äôt feel as if we spent the entire day just going between islands. 

Public transportation is a cheap and convenient way to explore Oahu and we are so glad we chose to do that instead of renting a car on all the days. We spent a big chunk of our budget on activities and we would highly recommend all of the companies we went with - Zephyr Adventures Maui, Mauna Loa helicopters, NaPali adventure tour with Blue ocean adventures, and the UTV tour at Kualoa ranch. 

We also liked all the restaurants and food trucks we ate at, and cooking several of our meals helped us save costs and also keep our tummies light and healthy.",VisitingHawaii

I am technically saying the trip as a ""work"" trip so we are both working for part of the trip. It is only so I can keep the proposal a secret. I wanted to combine a resort experience with a nice pool but close to the beach. I was wondering what the recommendations are? I keep going through the costco hotels to figure out what hotel I would like to stay out but as I spend more time, the more confused I get.

&#x200B;

I have been looking at the Royal Hawaiian, Moana Surfrider, and Queen Kapi'olani. My budget for the hotel is roughly $2,800.  I like the idea that Royal Hawaiian and Moana Surfrider offer activities to do like ukulele lessons, music, hula lessons, and yoga. I keep looking at reviews and just can not decide on what I want so I was hoping to get feedback from others.

I looked at outrigger hotels, but I have had a bad experience with Aston which operates the same way. Aston rooms are owned by people who are responsible for the furniture and upgrading the amenities. We stayed in Maui in an Aston hotel and the first room was very outdated and did not match any of the photos. We got upgraded on day 3, but not a great experience. Outrigger hotel follows the same model so I am trying to avoid that.

We are currently booked for two partial oceanfront rooms LongBoard Club at Alohilani. I understand it was an older building that was redone, and based on what I've read:  
\-people seem to either love it, or think it was not up to standard.   
\-it's hip, great rooftop poolbar, rooms and elevators leave a lot to be desired  
\-great mostly central waikiki location

We are only here two nights, and have some tours so I'm not too crazy concerned but I'd love some feedback because Prince Waikiki also has Club Level rooms and with a summer promo, it's coming out to about the same price.  
I know there are a LOT of diehard Prince fans and I can tell from reviews it is very well loved, the staff is beyond amazing and it's a lovely place to stay. I guess what I am asking for is if anyone has experience with their Club Level specifically, and what they thought? Is the location being so far down by the marina burdensome if you're trying to be closer to stuff in Waikiki (shops, food, etc). Has anyone done Alohilani and Prince and can offer some idea of the differentials firsthand?  


Because this resort choice kicks off our vacation, to some extent that service element matters. My family has never been to Hawaii and it sounds like the Prince is really amazing to arrive to and stay at! For reference, we are a family of six - 2 adults with three adult children and one 13 year old.

1686154036.0,A couple of questions about a trip to Oahu,"Hey everyone! My husband and I have been talking about going to Hawaii for the first time for quite a while, and we‚Äôve finally decided to make it happen in February of 2025. We want to give ourselves plenty of time to save so that we can make it a once in a lifetime experience!

Obviously this is a long way away, but Im super excited so I‚Äôve already started planning. We‚Äôll be on Oahu for 8 nights and 7 days. I have a few questions!

1. My husband loves being spontaneous on vacation, whereas I‚Äôm more of a planner. So we‚Äôve decided to do kind of a mix of both. One of our spontaneous days is going to be a drive up the windward coast, just kind of taking in the sites and stopping wherever we feel like. I know there are a lot of popular spots there, so I thought it would be a good place to just stop at whatever looks cool. Obviously we do have a few spots we want to try to hit, but we‚Äôre just going to kind of take it easy. My question is about food. I‚Äôd like to have a few good options near the coast that we can hit if we‚Äôre in the area so that we don‚Äôt have to eat a hot dog at a crappy tourist trap. Any recommendations?

2. Since we will be there in February, we‚Äôre obviously hoping to see some whales. I know Maui is the best for that, but most of our must hit spots are on Oahu and we really want to take in everything we can on the island instead of trying to island hop. I‚Äôve heard that you can see whales from Makapuu lighthouse, and I think I‚Äôve heard of some whale watching tours as well. I know sometimes you just have to get lucky, but be honest with me. Where are the best places to get lucky, and should I not get my hopes up? 

3. We are considering the Queen Kapiolani hotel. I LOVE the look of their Diamond Head views, so I think we‚Äôre going to upgrade to one of those. It looks like it‚Äôs close to the action, but still far enough away to not be horribly crowded and loud. Has anyone stayed here? What did you think?

Any other recommendations or tips are definitely appreciated! I know it‚Äôs a long way off, but I‚Äôm so excited!!!",VisitingHawaii

Looking at all the resorts, there's so many great choices but a bit overwhelming and we aren't sure which one is best for our family. Hoping you can help. Here's the things we are looking for in our stay:

-- A modern resort with great amenities. We like the resort feel and would like something updated, clean, and spacious (as much as you can get at a resort). A large resort for my teens to run and explore would be great. We'd love to let them go adventure out. We will have a car and will go offsite (hike, zipline, etc...), but I expect a large chunk of time to be spent at the resort. So having a resort that has activities and places to explore will stave off some of that famous teenage bordem.
-- We like to swim. My teens would love some awesome pools to explore. I'm allergic to chlorine so it's all about the beach for me. Resorts that have both great pools and beaches would be great. 
-- Food at the resort or within walking distance would be great. Bonus points for a breakfast buffet (these kids eat a lot. Seriously, the food bills are nuts, üòÑ). 
-- A Luau at resort would be awesome. 
-- Cost is a thing, but we are willing to pay for quality and experience. The Grand Wailea is probably too much cost wise for us, but right below that is okay.

Family of 8, ranging from infant to seniors, and mobility issues are a consideration in our planning.  We've really appreciated the posts and links provided here and the information has been immensely helpful in our planning. Given our budget and desire to be beachfront in Waikiki, we're most seriously considering either the Moana Surfrider or Outrigger Reef and could use a little feedback, as we're just going in circles at this point. These are pros and cons of each that stood out to us (but please correct if any of these are inaccurate).

**Moana Surfrider:** 

Pros are opportunity to stay at an iconic/historic hotel; we were charmed by the beauty of the property and the amazing banyan tree covering the patio area; love the beachfront dining area and ability to listen to live music at night while being on the sand.  


Cons are that rooms could be more outdated; the on-site parking is actually quite a ways away, so we'd either be making a trek or have to use valet each time we need the car, which we'll plan to be using throughout the entire week

**Outrigger Reef:**

Pros are recently renovated and refreshed rooms; have heard it is in a quieter section of the beach; overall strong reviews re: service; maybe Monkeypod kitchen will be open on the property by then.

Cons are we've heard the beach in front may be rather short and rocky; doesn't have the same historic charm as Moana ; on-site restaurant appears to be at the pool area and perhaps not right by the sand?

Day 1: Leave early (how early is optimal? 6AM? earlier?) and go south on Highway 11 so that we can visit Punalu'u Beach on our way to HVNP.  Arrive at the park midday, get lunch and drop bags.  Complete Chain of Craters driving tour and do short hikes this day (Devastation Trail, Puu Loa Petroglyphs, Steam Bluff and Sulfur Banks a few on my list).  We are from Texas so well aware of how brutal hiking midday is which is why we want to keep the hikes short.

Night 1: Stay at Volcano House, check out lava at night.

1681489553.0,General-ish Visiting Questions for Kauai and Big Island,"Hi there! I've been reading so many awesome suggestions and post from all the individual islands and this sub but none really entertain the idea of a 2 year old in tow lol.

I'm hoping to visit the last week of April 2024 for 6 days (and 2 days for travel). Haven't book flights yet so I don't really know what the timing is quite yet. We want to do Kauai for leg 1 and Big Island for leg 2. 

It is me, my almost 2 year old, and my husband (or my sister if he can't get the time off work). We don't plan on packing in a huge itinerary because of the short time on each island plus the short patience of my toddler.

My questions/advice needs so far:

1. We are trying to do the trip as cheap and as not crowded as we can. Tentatively trying to stay in North Kauai near Princeville. Again, it is one of the more affordable areas we found. Is that a good area to chill? We are going to get a rental car but hope to not use it very often. 
2. We want to spend most of our time hiking (we have a backpack carrier for my daughter but still want to stay 6 miles or under,) relaxing on the beach, and eating the best native cuisine we can find. That is basically our only itinerary for Kauai so far. Everyone says do something on the Na Pali coast so a hike or beach time there might be nice. We can't do boat/heli tours because of the toddler. Any suggestions for the following activities welcome.
3. We are flying to the Big Island at the half way point. How much time is that going to eat up in the day?
4. Our Big Island itinerary is the Volcano National Park, snorkeling, Kona Brewing (heard the nachos used to be banger - is that still true lol,) and chilling on the beach again hopefully. We plan to snorkel at Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park. Are we allowed to get our own snorkel mask and do our own thing or do we have to go with a group? Also is this a good place to just lay on the beach/swim around the shallow parts or should we find a different beach for that?
5. We found a cabin on a farm near South Point Park (sort of, might be farther south.) How is that drive to/from Kona airport? I know the distance but is is scenic/rough terrain/etc? I figured it was a cheap place to stay and half way between the Kona area and the Volcano park. I also thought it would be nice to get the experience of a Hawaiian farm. (If not obvious we plan on getting another rental car.)
6. Rental cars on both islands - I know they are expensive post-Covid. Any website that is better to book than others?
7. Are there any ""must do"" scenic hikes on the Big Island we should try and squeeze in? Or possible sunrise/sunset/stargaze stuff (this goes for either island actually.)
8. Obviously we will do some light touristy shopping on both islands. Are there better towns than others we should poke around in? Just walk around and buy some things, get a bite, to eat, relax between adventures...) I don't have any lodging booked yet so if there are ""have to do"" towns that are super far away from the places I mentioned we might stay, feel free to let me know and I can possibly adjust our stays.

I hope this isn't too long/oblivious. I'm a tired/excited mom that is just trying to get an idea of what I'm in for. It will be all of our first times. Yes I know my kid is super young and probably won't remember anything. I also know a lot of people suggest leaving the littles at home. Just not an option for me.

1678458863.0,"Is going into Waipi'o Valley ""bad tourism""?","Like so many others I've seen photos and read stories of Waipi'o Valley and find the place enchanting.  I'd love to visit it on an upcoming trip to the Big Island, but I see there's been a lot of drama over the past few years, especially about the somewhat treacherous road that accesses the valley.

If I have the story straight:

* Waipi'o Valley Road is a county road that used to be treated mostly just like any other road, despite being the steepest road in the USA.  Locals and tourists alike were free to drive or walk the road (although it was marked as a 4x4 only road).

* As it became a more popular destination (thanks Instagram), crowding increased, some rockfalls and road deterioration happened and the County of Hawai'i closed the road to everyone but people who lived in Waipi'o Valley.

* Locals who lived near, but not in, Waipi'o Valley were upset about not being able to reach the black sand beach, etc, and filed a lawsuit.  Eventually the restriction was changed - access was opened to include not just residents of Waipi'o Valley, but also tour groups, Hawaiian cultural practitioners and all County of Hawai'i (Big Island) residents.

So at first I thought, great, I can just go as part of a tour group.  Something like the [Waipi'o Valley Shuttle](https://www.waipiovalleyshuttle.com) or even staying at [Waipi'o Gardens](https://www.waipiogardens.com).  They both have shiny websites and don't mention that anything contentious is going on.

But googling further I find [stories about Waipi'o Valley residents telling tourists to stay away](https://www.sfgate.com/hawaii/article/waipio-valley-residents-protest-visitors-17462196.php), or [the Facebook page for the group that organizes protests](https://www.facebook.com/protectwaipiovalley/) at the start of the road.

So now I'm 99% sure accessing Waipi'o Valley in any way is an example of being a bad haole going where they aren't welcome.  Or am I getting fringe opinions and visiting the valley really is no big deal?",VisitingHawaii

My s/o and I are planning a luxury trip to Oahu. By luxury, I mean do and experience some of the things we have always wanted but could not justify financially. 

One of these things is staying in a Waikiki hotel with ocean views. The items that are important are 1) ocean view 2) attentive service 3) calm atmosphere 4) rooms whose aesthetic we like (for instance, Royal Hawaiian is not my style)

I was all set to pony up for Halekulani when I discovered that Halepuna, its sister hotel, checks all the boxes but costs on average $400 per night less.

The question is, what are the things you‚Äôre paying for with Halekulani? The list as far as I can tell is:

‚Äîbigger rooms, 420 sq ft (500 with lanai) vs 288 at Halepuna

‚Äîlanai vs small balcony

‚Äîpool that is bigger and closer to the ocean (Halepuna has a small infinity pool on a high floor so it looks like you‚Äôre right on the ocean but you‚Äôre not). 

‚Äîcloser access to beach and in house restaurants (but marginally)

‚Äîjust the general historic character of the hotel. 

‚Äîmore white in the decor, lol

What else?

Now I know that you generally don‚Äôt spend too much time on your hotel while traveling‚Ä¶ but I actually think we will spend at least a day at the hotel pool and will want to have a slow start and end to each day in the room.

I‚Äôve never stayed at a hotel like either of those before. It used to typically be cheap Airbnb or barely above motel level for me, so I‚Äôm sure either will feel great. I‚Äôm stuck between FOMO wrt Halekulani and being sensitive to the price difference.

The landscape is gorgeous and the people, specifically many, if not all, of the service workers working at the hotels, restaurants, and tourist areas were exceptionally kind. But Hawaii sounds and feels like a dystopia. 

This is my second trip to Oahu with family. I really don‚Äôt know much about indigenous Hawaiian culture. I only am able to ‚Äúafford‚Äù the privilege to go to Hawaii because the rest of my extended family makes enough to help pay for the hotel/resort, rental car, and other necessary expenses. I‚Äôm in my 20‚Äôs and Asian American if that gives some perspective on my ‚Äúlife experience‚Äù. Additionally, my family only ever goes to touristy areas and beaches. Our hotels/resorts are also of course all tourists and are more on the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù side with restaurants, bars, valet, etc..

It makes sense that of course if we only visit the tourist spots, we‚Äôll only see the glamorous parts of Oahu. But the parts that really stuck out to me were seeing so many white tourists and rich AF asian tourists, while many of the service workers were tanned/darker skinned and many times on the older side. It really solidified the image of the colonization of Hawaii and I hated it. I hated seeing these older service workers knowing they likely aren‚Äôt receiving any benefits from the mass tourism industry, since so many of the hotels and rental cars are owned by corporations outside Hawaii. I just felt like I was infringing on such a sensitive space.

- Hawaiian food (of course!): Pretty much anything (except pork üòï) but I love chicken katsu, rice, and macaroni salad  

- Vietnamese food: Specifically the best pho 

- Indian food: Love everything but my favorites are chicken vindaloo, naan, chicken tikka masala, samosas

- Mexican food: Tacos, burritos (pura carne), pretty much anything with carne asada

- Soul food: This is one of my favorites and I‚Äôm talking plates with fried chicken, turkey legs, collard greens, mac and cheese, yams, the whole nine lol. 

***Any black owned establishments are highly encouraged and appreciated since I want to support. üòä

- Italian food: I love pasta with one of my favorites being gnocchi, spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo, etc. Any exceptional local pizza spots are highly recommended and appreciated. 

- Japanese food: Sushi, RAMEN (tr√®s ono), or practically anything 

- Thai food: Looooove pad prik king, thai fried rice, and drunken noodles. 

- Seafood (general): Mostly love any shellfish (favs are crab, lobster, shrimp, crawfish, clams, and mussels). In terms of bony fish, I mostly pass unless there‚Äôs a place that sells really good fish. I hate the way catfish tastes so anything that doesn‚Äôt taste like catfish lol (love tuna and salmon)

Dessert: Any ice cream or gelato places. Of course, Hawaiian shaved ice!

Right now we're considering Oct 22 till Nov 14, but we have some questions before we pin the dates and start reserving stuff.

From what we're read, October/November is off-season. That means flights and hotels are less expensive, but the weather is slightly colder, with more chance of rain.

What we can't find is how else this might influence our trip, for example because some things aren't organised during off-season.

* Is there anything to keep in mind when renting cars then? How far in advance should we reserve them?
* We would like to do a helicopter flight on Kaua'i, do those still fly then?
* Is snorkelling different in that period? We're completely inexperienced. We might do something with a group, or go out by ourselves, but definitely not too far. The Mermaid Cave in O'ahu would be nice though.
* We read that the Na Pali coast is pretty by catamaran, do those still go out then?
* Will there still be those 'traditional' dinner shows? We would like to experience at least one.
* Will we have reasonable odds of seeing the first whales of the season?
* Is there anything else we should know about visiting during October/November that we might not have considered yet? Anything that is closed during off-season?

1698887700.0,2023 vacation,"I'm pretty bummed that after 25 years of visiting Kauai, I couldn't see Kee beach in the Haena state park during the past few trips. Getting reservations is near impossible, failed getting a  parking spot within minutes of the website offering them at 12 midnight Hawaii time, or paying 140$ for our family of 4 for the shuttle is pretty costly for a day at the beach. I keep reading articles that proudly say it's tourism management, but that's bogus because if that was the real reason the shuttle shouldn't be a whopping 35$. They refuse to give numbers on the actual dollars this is generating. It sounds like it's profit driven tho it's a non-profit I know. 
Sounds just like another way to charge entry to a beach that is suppose to legally be accessible to all. 

Now I hear it's so ""successful"" they want to expand the $$ system to the next door beach which is seeing all the tourists denied access to Kee. I comprehend the need to throttle the amount of tourists in the area but a 5-10$ a person shuttle bus to the beaches with reservations is a far fairer approach.  At 35$ you're just gatekeeping with those who can afford it. It just stinks.

1691389900.0,Working remote for two weeks,"Hi, my wife and I work remotely and like to occasionally travel to other places for a change of scenery. Since my work hours are west coast based, I'll be free after roughly 1 or 2 pm everyday. We're not interested in seeing every sight, but more taking in the local scene, eating and drinking out, doing some beach days, and light exploring or hiking. I'd also like to surf somewhere very chill and friendly, I surfed a lot in socal but it's been a few years since I've been in the water.

I'm trying to map out a rough plan for two weeks and would like a sanity check to see if this makes sense. 

For week 1, we'd stay within walking distance to Waikiki for the first week probably in a hotel (any recs?). Is there a better beach for chill surfing that's not crazy crowded? 

For week 2, we'd hop to Maui and spend the week there with a rental car. I'm less certain about this plan, and could also be persuaded to not spend the extra time hopping between islands. But if we did go to Maui, where should we stay that is similarly near a good beginner surfing break? 

Lastly, wherever we stay needs a good enough Internet connection to video chat to allow us to work.

1. **Access to road cycling**. We're spandex-wearing road cycling types. Not an absolute must, but we'd love to be able to spend a couple of full days on bikes. We've heard Maui is the best island for this.
2. **Outdoor opportunities**. We love to hike and get outdoors. Strenuous hikes in beautiful places is our jam. We've heard Kauai is better for hiking, but the time of year and rainfall there gives me pause. I don't want to spend all day hiking in the mud. 
3. **Weather and beaches**. I'm turning 40, and I want to spend a few days doing nothing on the beach. I can tolerate a little rain and clouds, but I do want to get some sunshine on a nice beach.
4. **We're not resort people and don't care about nightlife.** We stay in and cook a lot. We enjoy going out to a nice dinner, but don't care about bars and stuff. We're also planning on booking Airbnbs because we're just not into the resort thing.
5. **This is our first time to Hawaii, but we'll probably be back again in the not-to-distant future**. Seems like this is a factor. We do want a ""classic"" Hawaiin experience (beaches, nature, etc.), but we live in California, so it's not too tough for us to visit again.

1656321312.0,Family Vacation,"Hey all!

I posted on here about two months ago; we were planning a trip and had chosen O'ahu as our destination. That has obviously changed, and we will now be visiting Maui, with a quick island hop because Pearl Harbor is a must-see for us.

So, a quick recap of my last post;

*It's been my mother-in-law's lifelong dream to visit Hawai'i. We‚Äôve been talking about it for years, but since her health is slowly deteriorating (COPD, and early onset dementia / Alzheimer‚Äôs), we finally found the motivation, and we‚Äôre making it an extended family thing.*

*Going will be myself (M47), my wife (F39), our kids (M9, F7), my brother-in-law (M46), my mother-in-law (F70), and my parents (M76, F77).*

We'll be landing August 30th, and flying out on September 16th. We found what seems like a great place to stay in Kihei, but we have no issues driving to see the rest of the island. After going through my Lonely Planet travel guide, I have a bunch of questions.

\-- Best place for family surf lessons? So far it seems to be  Maui Surf Clinics in Lahaina

\-- The submarine excursion in Lahaina; can anyone recommend it?

\-- I've read the Old Lahaina Luau is the best one to go to... but it would cost our family of four 550$. I realise they feed you giant helpings of food and it's a show, but that price point seems a bit excessive. Other Luaus that I saw were not necessarily cheaper. What gives?

\-- I saw that Wailuke and Lahaina have Town Parties on the 1st and 2nd Friday of the month, but not a lot of details as to what the parties were, other than a ''festive'' atmosphere. Anyone can shed a light on this?

\-- The Maui Ocean Center looks like a nice rainy day activity. Am I wrong?

\-- Any idea when the Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area will open back up?

\-- Like stated above, my mother in law has lung issues. My father also had both his knees replaced a few months ago. Is the  Kapalua Coastal Trail  a realistic walk for them?

\-- We fully intend on hiking Waihe‚Äôe Ridge Trail and Pipiwai Trail. Is it a good idea to bring our kids and my mom along (who's in good shape despite her age)?

\-- Haleakala National Park: We'll definitely go for a sunrise. On the National Park Service site, it says we should plan for a half day if we want to hike to the Leleiwi Overlook, and into the crater. but a full day if we want to do the crater's edge AND the crater. That doesn't make much sens to me.  What should we realistically expect?

How bad would the drive to Kihei be if I also want to go for a sunset? I keep reading it's not recommended to drive at night.

\-- Road to Hana: Our plan now is to take a day to make it to Hana and back, and another day to do the Pi'ilani Highway for the Pipiwai Trail hike. What do the waterfalls look like in September, considering that it's the end of the dry season? From what I've read, I get the impression we'll be pressed for time and we'll have to run in and out of any scenic points so we can make it in as day. Will it be so bad on a weekday in September? If it is, what should we focus on to maximize our time?

\--Out of curiosity, when does school start in Maui?

\-- Pearl Harbor visit: We're dedicating two days to fly in and out to go visit Pearl Harbor. Any recommendations on where to sleep? Any can't miss things in Honolulu for the (very) brief time that we're there?

\-- Any thing else you guys can think of that's a must? Sights to see, places to eat, things to do?

I have a shoulder strain injury and a nagging soreness in my LCL from an old tear so I can't have them a) go as hard as they would on the rest of my body or b) totally ignore that section because the whole point is to get blood flow to help with the injuries. 

They also can't just have one speed. I have my best results when I get a ""medium"" deep tissue massage, not full intensity. 

Next, they cannot try and upsell me for the entire hour. My masseuse literally had another woman come in to try and upsell me on a 4 hands massage among many other things like hot stones and cupping. 

My final major factor is timing. If I'm paying for a one hour massage, as a professional you should have your timing down not to have the massage end 5 minutes before the hour. One to two minutes, sure, but 5 minutes, that's blatant theft. 

All that being said, any of you all have a spot you'd recommend with quality service and without these types of unprofessional practices, please let me know! I have a car but I'd prefer a 10-15 drive max from Waikiki unless you can guarantee a stellar experience.",VisitingHawaii

1675250332.0,First Time in Big Island,"Hello all,

Traveling to BI in two weeks. We haven‚Äôt booked our accommodations yet but leaning towards staying in Kona 13-16, then Hilo 17-19. We‚Äôre taking a flight to Kauai 16-17 to finish visiting all the Hawaiian islands.

We‚Äôre planning on checking out the must-dos in BI:
- Volcanoes National Park (definitely want to see lava)
- Mauna Kea Summit
- Waipio Valley Lookout
- Night Manta Ray Snorkeling

Everything else will just be a chill day, i.e. check out some of the recommended restaurants from reading through this sub. Would it be worth it to book tours or DIY? It would be nice to go to the observatory but would prefer carpooling to get there.

Also, we probably would only have the two days in Hilo for the summit and volcano. Is that enough or should we reverse the stay? Any reservations that we should make ahead of time?

Lastly, around what time would be best to be at the VNP and Mauna Kea?

Appreciate any/all input! Cheers!",VisitingHawaii
1675112364.0,2 to 3 month temporary relocation,"I‚Äôll start with some info about myself. 

I‚Äôm 25m from Texas and after feeling unfulfilled for quite some time at my job I decided to quit and move to New York state for a few months. I managed to find a job which included housing as well as a decent hourly wage which took care of the biggest things I needed to find once there. 
 I‚Äôm back in Texas and my time in New York was unforgettable and really helped my mental health. I‚Äôm going back to college and aiming to finish my bachelors degree starting August. 

Recently an old dream of mine rekindled and it is to visit Hawaii. Why not try to repeat what I did in NY but now in Hawaii. My temporary relocation to NY was well thought out as I‚Äôm not the type of person to do something drastic without a plan. 

I have some time before August and if I could find something similar in Hawaii that offered housing and some pay I‚Äôd immediately sign up. I did find one option that provides housing but no money and I know things can get expensive there. I have money saved up but I‚Äôd much prefer to have a job as well. I could sign up, get there, work the job that offers housing, find a second job for money. The job with housing only requires about 25 hours per week and lasts a month. A job that offers both housing and pay is ideal though.

1669762459.0,Advice for planning a trip to Hawaii,"I am planning to visit Hawaii next year together with a friend. The goal is to visit Hawaii for 10-13 days, we are flexible with this as we are bound by budget not time. We are early with planning, so we can thoroughly prepare and research what we would like to do. The target is to go in October next year.

From online articles, it is really hard to judge how many islands you can/should visit within that timeframe. We are thinking 2-3 islands (O'ahu, Maui, The Big Island), if we only go to 2 what would be the best option?

Another thing that I find fairly difficult to judge is if public transport will be good enough or if you need to rent a car to properly have all the experiences? It seems like renting a car would be extremely costly, at around $130 to $140 a day (this is out of budget). This might have something to do with the fact that we are both under 25.

1684347759.0,Avoid The Westin Hapuna Beach Resort if you enjoy being able to sleep,"I just got back from my vacation and I'm still pretty pissed that this happened, but especially when I paid $800 a night plus parking + resort fees to stay at a hotel. 

During the first night at the hotel when I was trying to sleep I started hearing really loud music in my room. Now if your neighbor at home is playing loud music you might hear the bass, this was literally lyrics and everything as there was a wedding happening three floors above me. I could barley hear my wife talk to me in my room. Despite going to the front desk three times, and waiting awhile the third time for the manager as she was speaking with other guests complaining about the same issue, each time the manager assured me that they'd turn down the music nothing changed.

To add insult to injury I could see wedding guests with young children going from the wedding to the north tower where the insanely loud music from the wedding wouldn't reach them while my family was denied the same privilege. They should've never booked a room for me with this happening, and had the wedding near the rooms of the guests. Further no one could tell me how the manager of the Westin can't control the volume at an event happening in the hotel. i kept getting told, ""Well I spoke with the event coordinator"", like you are the manager YOU fix this. 

I was assured the music would stop at 10, which is 1am at the earliest on the mainland, and it did not. I had to once again call the manager to have her get them to shut off the insanely loud music.
Lastly instead of being sympathetic the front desk told me, ""well it won't happen tomorrow."" Like do you want to be insanely jet lagged and not be able to sleep in your own hotel room?

Looking at the location the next morning the event was in a open room, while they could've had the event in one of the ballrooms which have doors that can close and are farther from guest rooms but the chose not too.
It's not like you can just sleep in either and the blinds are very minimal in the rooms and by 6am the room is quite bright.

1695966578.0,Visited Hawaii and I‚Äôm conflicted!,"I am currently in O‚Äôahu on a trip planned by my family. I started to educate myself on Hawaii‚Äôs history, culture ect once I arrived in Honolulu and to say the least I immediately felt awful being here. Growing up on the beach in my own country, I hated when tourists would trash the beach during tourist season and my usual spots would become packed, so I understood the tourism affect aspect (obviously not the historical illegal occupation part) of the feelings of native Hawaiians/locals and how they are feeling this on a much larger scale than I ever have. On a tour we had a tour guide who was an elder native Hawaiian. She took us through the North Shore of Oahu, and every local I bumped into was predominantly very friendly, sharing smiles as we walked past each other. The beach was pretty clean, but any rubbish I found on the floor I‚Äôd just clean up. The people at Waimea Falls who were displaying some traditional Hawaiian games and things like ropes and headbands were so friendly to us, they had even visited the area near my beach back home and we talked about this. Two local girls of poly/Samoan heritage whom we purchased bracelets from had family near my home and didn‚Äôt seem to mind that we were clearly tourists(I guess we did just buy something from them but still). My family has made sure to tip extremely generously, pick up rubbish off the beach, walk instead of clogging up the roads, and just be decent people. I was feeling so conflicted about being here, so I asked my guide Aunty Mary about whether the locals dislike tourists. Turns out Aunty Mary grew up/lives in the area of Jason Momoa‚Äôs family (relatives and father) and she said she contacted Jason after his post not to visit Maui. She said she was angry at him because Hawaii needs tourism and telling people not to come was the wrong idea and apparently his father wasn‚Äôt too happy about him doing that - ‚ÄúLahaina is closed but the rest of Maui and Hawaii is open‚Äù. If you look at Jasons‚Äôs post you‚Äôll see he deleted this post and has made ‚ÄòMaui is open‚Äô posts. In fact, she arranged for one of the people on my tour visiting Maui (Not Lahaina) to be picked up by her relatives and they are planning on showing him around. She said she has taken some of her family‚Äôs children who have been affected by the Lahaina fires to live with her in Oahu whilst they sort things out. So obviously this is incredibly conflicting with some native Hawaiians encouraging tourism and even extending such favours such as showing foreigners around the island out of the goodness of their hearts versus some saying there is absolutely no ethical way to visit Hawaii, particularly during the time of fires in Lahaina, Maui. Hawaii is undeniably a beautiful group of Islands, and I think tourists don‚Äôt visit with the intention of ruining the place, upsetting the locals or encouraging the declining trends in Native Hawaiian‚Äôs quality of life such as the homelessness problem. I think they are just uneducated, and can you really blame them when the history of Hawaii is not taught in countries outside of America and the travel industry/social media SELLS Hawaii as the ideal vacation? I personally feel as though once I leave Hawaii it will be as if I was never there because I left no trace of rubbish, shopped as local as possible, tipped as generously as possible, didn‚Äôt go anywhere where I shouldn‚Äôt have (sacred sites/local only areas), stayed away from wildlife and endangered flora and just mainly educated myself on Hawaii‚Äôs history and culture. Now will I come back to Hawaii? Probably not - Despite what Aunty Mary has told me, that she in fact WANTS tourism and is happy for me to come back to her Island, it‚Äôs probably largely due to the fact that many Hawaiians like herself work in the tourism industry because they don‚Äôt really have many other choices. It‚Äôs a really sharp double edge sword because there will always be bad tourists despite there being good tourists, and there will always be positives and negatives to everything. Do I think it‚Äôs possible for tourists to visit Hawaii and be respectful and leave as if they were never there whilst appreciating the culture and aesthetics of the land? Yes. But is the tourism industry full of faults like using up precious fresh water, taking up land that could be used for homes, creating road traffic, increasing the property/cost of living prices by allowing affluent properties to be built and developed, and so many other things? Yes. This whole issue boils directly down to the fact that things aren‚Äôt the way they should/used to be and that makes it really difficult to solve because the illegal occupation of Hawaii can never be reversed (Hopefully can be amended, but you can‚Äôt turn back time and make it not happen in the first place). So, leaving Hawaii now as a definitely more educated individual who is extremely grateful to have been treated nicely and saw some incredibly beautiful places, but also a very conflicted individual, because this issue surrounding Hawaii has never ever been brought up in my home country by anyone , or anywhere until I researched it myself. I would love to hear people‚Äôs thoughts on this and their experiences ü´∂Mahalo",VisitingHawaii

I like spending time with my family, and to stay at home would offend them greatly, especially since they've already purchased the tickets and reserved the hotel.

They, and others online \[[1](https://www.melaninbasecamp.com/trip-reports/2022/2/12/3-reasons-why-traveling-to-hawaii-is-not-sustainable)\], have made clear their opinion that tourists should not be visiting Hawaii right now. I respect this perspective, and so I am a bit queasy about visiting Hawaii.

I have read a bit online about the best ways to make a trip to Hawaii a bit more sustainable and ethical. A number of resources seem to suggest: a) making sure your dollars support (less advantaged) locals, and b) ""giving back"". \[[2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/tips/hawaii-safe-travels-maui-covid/)\] \[[3](https://www.gohawaii.com/voluntourism)\]

I am currently a college student, so my ability to decide how my family spends money in Hawaii is a bit limited: it's not my money.

So far, my best idea to help make my family's visit more ethical are:

1. Compile restaurant / farmer's market recommendations that directly benefit Hawaiians.
2. Identify one or two of the best ""voluntourism"" options, and galvanize as much of my family as possible to give back to the Islands in this way.

I would like to visit any of the Hawaiian islands during June (around 6/6 - 6/21), ***mainly*** for surfing but also because of warm weather, spending time in a peaceful environment, and to unwind after my 6m stay in the States and before I go back home to Europe. 

I am 23 y.o. (f), visiting the U.S. for 6 month internship. I will travel solo and I really do not want to stay in a big city like Honolulu or any famous touristic location, simply because I don't like the rush of a big city and crowds of touristy people. I would consider myself a fit person, I do not mind hiking the trails, walking to the beach, or to the next village to buy food.

I searched for places to surf during summer on google - what I found out is just ""visit south shores"" but I hoped for specific locations or at least recommendations. I have some experience in surfing from spots in Spain and Ireland so I know the basics but I'm not anywhere near being at least ""a good surfer"". Could you please recommend a place to go? I will be grateful for any guidance, or specific recommendations, even a good surf school (I need a surf rental as well, I don't have my own :( ), a beach with nice waves, a local stay or anything that could help me to stay for \~2weeks and get confident on the board more! üèÑüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But I WILL have a rental car the entire time.

Here's my main question: from Sat-Tues I have accommodations in the north near Kilauea. **Should I leave after that and head south from Tues-Thurs? Or should I just extend my stay in the North and plan on driving south for activities down there?** I know that moving areas with a short timeline isn't ideal but I also want to be realistic if it'll be a pain driving back and forth to stuff. If there's enough to do up north I don't mind at all staying there the whole time, but a lot of the recommendations I've seen are around the southwest parts.

**Any specific recs for a solo female?** I am equal parts active and relaxed, like swimming and can handle a moderate hike for sure, but this is my first time travelling by myself in quite a bit and while I'm SO excited...I'm also a bit anxious and safety concerns always get into my head.

1686725669.0,Something I learned by visiting Hawaii is to do most of your shopping online and at Costco,"I had a stay in Maui. I did a vacation package online with Costco which was a good deal. We shopped at Costco coming off the plane for groceries and it was the same cost as shopping at home. We got some fruit from a shop off the road because Costco did not have them. Big mistake as we paid 13 dollars for a pineapple and a avocado and we could have gotten it cheaper at Safeway. We started looking for some things to take home to remember the vacation by. We like things like pendants or rings for these purposes. The jewelry places that come up are things like the pearl factory, No Hoku and Maui Divers. To my surprise none of those places came down in price. We eventually found Maui Arts And Gifts which had nice jewelry at affordable prices. I farther googled the jewelry that pops up at these expensive places and many can be found on Etsy for super cheap. I am talking half the prices or less of the jewelry stores like Maui Divers and No Hoku were offering them at. They may just be selling them from CA or TX opposed to Maui. We did do a Pearl opening where you pay 20 dollars and pick a pearl and that pearl is random. You cannot choose the Pearl characteristics but it is the pearl you choose to crack. It is really fun and something you will remember. I also got a Honu/sea turtle koa inlay which is not online or on the pearl factory website so I would do that in person. We figured out too late is was cheaper to book excursions online. I think our Malokini tour was double online when booking with the concierge but our lanai trip was the same. We likely could have road the ferry to Lanai and walked 10 minutes to the beach for half the price and got a similar experience though. So lesson learned just book online at Expedia or TripAdvisor if ever returning to Hawaii for excursions, look online for the trinkets and maybe do a pearl opening ceremony while there.",VisitingHawaii

Obviously if she was a good swimmer, that would open us up to more activities, but not sure she'll have time to learn by next month so wondering if it's worth it to still come and we'd still enjoy ourselves or whether we'd be better off waiting until she can.

Me and my husband have collected $8,000 worth of CC points since covid, so we have flexibility as far as expenses go (though I'd prefer not to use all of it)

Whether I stay in a resort or condo is irrelevant as long as it has at least a small kitchen. That means I'll need easy access to a grocery store. Having at least a small selection of restaurants is good too because I don't want to cook every day.

I'll also have a toddler and she loves to walk, sometimes for hours, so I'd love to be beachfront or nearly beachfront so I can open the front door and let her roam around as far and as long as she wants. For that, a condo might be nice but also a resort with large grounds would work well too.

Activities will need to be prioritized by how easy it is to bring a toddler along. Sandy beaches are ideal, especially if they are sheltered and wave size reduced. Shorter, easy access hikes are doable. Anything that can be driven up to and seen after a short walk is great. Anywhere that can be done with a stroller is great, which could include a walkable area with shopping.

What I definitely don't want is the bustle of Honolulu or any beach that is going to be crowded. Nightlife isn't needed because toddler is in bed by 7/8p. Something like the road to Hana would be mostly useless for a little kid (or at least my kid).

If it comes down to staying in Kihei again, would that be okay given the fires that happened in Lahaina? I want to be respectful and give people space, and yet I can also see how the local economy would be poor if everyone were to have that mindset so I'm not sure.",VisitingHawaii
1698634997.0,Booking a doors off solo helicopter tour on Kauai?,"At first I wanted to do the tour where they land at Jurassic falls, but then after reading about it online I've seen several recommendations for a doors off helicopter tour and by Jack Harter. It just worries me since the negative reviews are pretty much just about people being put in the middle seat when they wanted a window seat for better photos, and even a solo person who said they were unconfirmed and then had their flight cancelled at the last minute because a four-person group booked their same time slot. Since apparently Jack Harter only flies with fully booked helicopters holding 4 passengers, I'd have to be very lucky to have a 3-person group end up wanting to fly at the same time and day I would want to. 

Then there are other helicopter tour companies that only allow you to book in groups of two or more. Can anyone offer any advice about booking a solo helicopter tour on Kauai, and any helicopter tour companies that can give greater assurance that I won't get my unconfirmed flight suddenly cancelled, and that I won't be given a middle seat, due to my being a solo passenger? I'm about 5'11 and 175lbs, if that makes any difference about who is most likely to be given the middle seat. I might even be willing to pay the fare of two people to ensure a spot for myself and with a window seat, but I'm not sure if any of them would let me do that either. 

If it ends up too difficult to book something solo with a window seat doors off on Kauai, I figure maybe I'd have better luck on Oahu, where I'll be visiting too.

Love hiking, camping, and long road trips. We once did a three week road trip to Alaska from Texas, saw the sights, camped at the Arctic Ocean in Canada, etc and worked remote most those days too!

All that being said, we‚Äòre planning to do a 8-day trip to Hawaii and see three islands‚Ä¶. Here‚Äôs our itinerary ‚Äî just how crazy are we? Is it at least doable and are there things not worth it/things we‚Äôre missing out on? While the plan seems great on paper (to me at least), how executable is it‚Ä¶

Note: We are on a budget and are limited to the cheapest interisland flights - so those days/timings cant be changed unless we just entirely don‚Äôt do them.

Here we go.

**Day 1:** Arrive in O‚Äôahu early evening. Relax, visit a beach, etc.

**Day 2:** 6am shark dive, check out of hotel, visit Pearl Harbor (the history buff in our family really wants to go). Late afternoon flight to Maui. Relax in the evening.

**Day 3:** Early morning snorkel, then a slow morning & lunch at Wailea Beach. Start the Road to Hana right after lunch, make stops (still figuring out which ones) and stay in Hana for the night.

**Day 4:** Head down to the Pƒ´pƒ´wai Trail, do that hike and head back up on RTH. Would probably visit Wai‚ÄôƒÅnapanapa this day. Head towards the direction of Haleakala National Park and stay the night prob in Kula/as close as we can to the summit (the camping enthusiasts of our family are reallllly hoping we can get a reservation at Hosmer Grove when those open).

**Day 5:** Sunrise at HaleakalƒÅ, explore the park all day. One more night in the same place.

**Day 6:** Drive up to Paia, hang out around there all day and relax. Stay around there.

**Day 7:** Early morning flight to Big Island (Kona). Visit Greenwell Farms (we have a die-hard coffee lover) and head to HVNP after lunch. Spend the rest of the day and evening there. Stay in Volcano.

**Day 8:** Head up to Hilo, see a cacao farm and have lunch. Close the loop we‚Äôve been driving by heading back to KOA for our late afternoon flight out.

Which island would be your favorite to spend New Year\`s and what activity did you enjoy most so far? Where would you spend more time and why? 

I am very interested in the Hawaiian history and culture; What would be your recommendation for an authentic experience, which also supports preservation of the cultural heritage? 

We are both vegan and checked Happy Cow already, there seem to be a lot restaurants with vegan options on both islands, mostly in Honolulu. Are there any traditional Hawaiian dishes, that are ""accidently"" vegan? And how is in in general supermarkets: Is is possible to get soy yogurt anywhere (this proofed to be quite a difficult task in California, for whatever reason....)?

For getting around we planned to rent a car. In California we made very good experiences with an e-car, there were fast chargers even in remote areas in the dessert... How is it in Maui with e-cars? Are there any chargers on the road to Hana? 

I wanted to book the flight between the islands already but was wondering if it would be better to wait regarding the fluctuation of flight prices?

I hate the idea of going when there's a bunch of tourists (even though I am myself) and while I was originally thinking about staying in Ko Olina or the north shore to stay away from all of that, our itinerary makes it infinitely more convenient to stay in Waikiki. I'm not against pushing it back a couple of weeks if it means it's a little bit more peaceful. I don't mind so much the noise or the music or the regular hustle and bustle, there's just something about a bunch of noisy people running around being annoying that I dislike.

1665002352.0,What can a non-resident do to support better bicycling infrastructure and culture?,"So considering Hawaii's weather is considered ideal for outdoors activities, I wonder why unlike Wisconsin (where it's either too hot or too cold half the time), there is little to no quality bicycle infrastructure. 

Last time my family and I (California residents) visited Oahu near Waikiki beach around 9 months ago, we did not rent a car, and we were able to transport everything (including my partial scuba kit) by bags and on foot. Now that I am part of my local bicycle coalition and pretty much bike everywhere on my newly purchased Fx 2 Disc and Fx 1 Stagger, I got to thinking that I could do everything transport wise in Hawaii, but with a bicycle, rack, and maybe a trailer for extra large and heavier cargo.

The problem is that as Shifter, City Beautiful, Not Just Bikes, and others have demonstrated, the infrastructure in Hawaii is lacking, and overall there is also the problem of automobile proliferation as the mainland US also has.

1690253162.0,BI Report 7/18/23 - 7/22/23," 

We flew out on July 15 on **Alaska Airline**s. The first flight from Sacramento to San Diego was uneventful. The flight from San Diego to Kona was first delayed an hour for some reason. After boarding, we sat on the runway for a while and then had to go back to the terminal for ‚Äúadjustments‚Äù and ‚Äúcertification‚Äù. After refueling, we finally flew out. Unfortunately, they ran out of ice mid-flight.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Upon arrival in Kona, there was a wait behind about 6 women to use the restroom. Then we took a shuttle to the **Budget Rental** agency. After missing 6 shuttles that were full, we finally caught a Budget shuttle. The line at the Budget counter was out the door. An hour and a half after arrival we finally got the rental car.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We then drove to the **Hilton Hawaiian Villag**e in Waikaloa where they could not find our reservation. (We had originally registered for 7/15 - 7/22. Then changed to 7-11 - 7/18. I don‚Äôt know how they came up with reservations for 7/18 - 7/24. My SIL (sister-in-law) made reservations using her friend‚Äôs timeshare.) The timeshare office could not be reached, apparently, they don‚Äôt have 24-hour service.  I realize that the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù messed up but since we would be staying only 4 of the 7 nights, I feel that they could have made changes. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hilton flat out refused to change our reservations that we had paid for, but could offer a room for $500 per night.  We went to [booking.com](http://booking.com/) and found **Bears' Place Guest Hous**e for $308. So decided to spend the night there. The room was clean and had a beautiful patio. By the time we got settled, it was ten o‚Äôclock, so we got to eat at Denny‚Äôs the first night.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**July 16**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We couldn‚Äôt get assistance from the timeshare, so we booked another 2 nights at Bear‚Äôs Place. We went to the **Kokua Kailua Village Stroll**. They had a bunch of vendors across from the beach and we enjoyed the shopping.  I was delighted to find **Steve's Akaka Falls Farm**s booth. We bought 7 jars of jam! We bought souvenirs from several other vendors. This area is not good for people with disabilities. The streets are uneven and many of the shops are up lava rock steps.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We had brunch at **Kalikala Cuisine**. The ambiance was beautiful overlooking the beach. The food was mediocre.  After waiting for a while, we overheard the server tell another customer that it would be an hour's wait. I ordered eggs over hard and bacon. I was brought eggs that were too gross to eat and ham. Apparently, they ran out of bacon. The worse part was the bathroom. You had to take a key and go up 3 sets of several steps down an alley. There was no handicapped access. The bathroom was extremely outdated and didn‚Äôt seem very sanitary.

&#x200B;

We had dinner at the **Fish Hopper.** It was incredible. I had the macadamia nut encrusted mahi-mahi and the wasabi mashed potatoes. My companions also had seafood plates and we all loved our food. The restaurant looks out over the bay and the servers are very friendly and attentive. 

&#x200B;

**July 17**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We started out with breakfast at the **Pine Tree Caf**e. It was very crowded with what seemed to be locals. I had the spam & eggs. Hubby tried Loco Moco. We both thought it was great. My eggs were excellent. SIL complained because we had to eat outside and there was a fly, but she did admit the eggs were really good. The restrooms were clean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We then took the **Shaka Guide** app tour. It was glitchy and sometimes the GPS was off. I found the narrator offensive because at times he was attempting to be funny and talk pidgin. We drove around and listened to the narrative. It was mostly historical tales which were interesting, but we were more into finding beaches and shopping. We did find **Big Island Bees** and stocked up on honey.

&#x200B;

We came back to **Quinn's Almost by the Sea** for dinner. The parking in Kailua-Kona is chaotic. We had mixed reviews for Quinn‚Äôs. We had appetizers of fried zucchini, onion rings, and fried pickles. They were wonderful and so was the service. SiL and I both ordered the Mahi Mahi fish and chips. The Mahi was very fishy tasting. SIL complained and they didn‚Äôt charge her. I didn‚Äôt say anything. OTOH hubby loved his entree. The bathroom door did not latch and could use a good cleaning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**July 18**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The first stop was the **Kona Sea Salt Farm**. They gave us a tasting of various salts with pineapple, tomatoes, and cucumbers to try the salt. We stocked up on salt but later found the same salt much cheaper at the **ABC stores**. Next up was the **Ocean Rider Seahorse farm**. We just went to the gift shop because I wanted a glass seahorse figurine. Then we drove back to Waikaloa and had lunch at **Macaroni Gril**l. I had delicious lobster bisque soup.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then it was time to check into the Hilton. First of all, we had to go to the main lobby for pre-check-in. Then we took a train to the Ocean Tower. The AC on the train was not working and we could not roll down the windows. Then the train had to stop before we got to OT because another train had broken down. We had to walk the rest of the way. Next was the Ocean Tower check-in. Then we were pulled into a room to talk to the ‚Äúconcierge‚Äù.  She gave us all shell leis and juices. Then she started the sales pitch. First of all, offering a discount to the luau. We told her we were not interested. Then she offered a free sunset cruise. It was determined that I could not get on the boat because of my disabilities. So she gave us all shopping bags and a box of macadamia nut candy to share. She finally offered us each a $50 visa ($150 total) if we would go to a 90-minute sales presentation. Hubby said yes so we booked our appointment for the following day. Tropical Storm Calvin was brewing and we thought that we would be rained in anyway.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dinner was at **A-Bay‚Äôs Island Gri**ll. It was delicious. I had shrimp lumpia for dinner. SIL said her hamburger was the best she had ever had. We dined on the patio. It was extremely windy because of the tropical storm, but we wanted to hear the singer, **Sebrina Barron**. She had a beautiful voice and was very enthusiastic.  

&#x200B;

**July 19**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We started the day with our timeshare pitch. The 90 minutes was actually 2 hours. We did get the gift cards. We then went over to the Kings or Queens Marketplace. (I get them mixed up in my head.). We shopped and bought lots of souvenirs. We ate at **L&L Barbecue.** I had my first Loco Moco and loved it. Hubby had Kailua pork and cabbage. He loved his meal.  

&#x200B;

The next stop was A-Bay Beach. It might have been because of Calvin which had just passed through but the water was nasty. We went back to the adult pool at the Hilton. There is a towel-dispensing machine next to a flight of marble steps that lead to the pool. The steps had no tread strips. Wet marble is extremely slippery. My husband tripped on one of the steps and twisted his ankle and tweaked his knee. The guards offered to get an ambulance but he wanted to see how it was the next day. They did provide a wheelchair, an ace bandage, and ziplock bags with ice. We were driven in a golf cart through the Hilton underbelly tunnel. At one point there was an open bag of food trash on the ground with cockroaches.  (It was still there the next day.). 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**July 20**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After a restless night with no sleep because of pain, we took hubby to urgent care in Waimea. They sent him to the Waimea ER. The ER staff were very friendly and professional. He was treated by Dr. Duke. X-rays were taken and there were no broken bones. However, Dr Duke said he might have a torn Meniscus. There was no way to tell without an MRI which they did not have. Anyway, he was prescribed painkillers and crutches. After picking up prescriptions, we stumbled across **Merriman‚Äôs Restaurant.** This was the best restaurant that we tried on Big Island.  I tried Saimin for the first time and it‚Äôs so delicious.  The bowl was so big that I could only eat about 1/3 of it.  

We then tried the Shaka guide route to Hilo. The highlight was **Rainbow Falls**. We doubled back to Hilo and everything was shutting down. We had dinner at **Jackie Reys**. Nothing on the menu appealed to me, so I ordered the Guava glazed ribs. I couldn‚Äôt taste the guava but the ribs were very tender. Hubby had the Steak Au Poivre which he loved. SIL tried the Gnocchi with Prawns. She loved the prawns but not the gnocchi. They had a one-stall bathroom in the restaurant. You had to take a hike to the others and remember the code to get in them. Hubs was in pain so we drove the southern route back to the Hilton. He also came down with a cold.

&#x200B;

**July 21**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was our last day, and SIL wanted to hang out by the pool. Hubby & I went shopping instead. I got my exercise trying to push the wheelchair around the resort. It was mainly brick and flagstone which are not wheelchair friendly. The resort was built in the 80s and is not ADA-friendly at all. We went back to the shops and bought more goodies. We had a late lunch at **A-Bays**. I had a hamburger patty with gravy and hubby had loco moco. Once again it was excellent. We went back to the Hilton and found that they had finally fixed the train but there was still no AC in the handicapped car. The Hilton is on 62 acres and has several pools, a lagoon, and a dolphin pool. We never saw anything but the hotel portion, so we decided to take the boat tour. The operator would not board a wheelchair, so we left it in the room and hubby used the crutches. The boat tour was a joke. It only went around to the various hotel towers and nowhere near the resort area. So we never saw any of that.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**July 22**

Flight from Kona to Seattle was uneventful, except they did not have the Hawaiian Sun Juice, pretzels, or biscotti. Seattle was a different story. First of all, another plane was blocking our gate so they had to route us to a different terminal. What was supposed to be a 3-hour layover turned into a 4-1/2. They did not have a jet for our flight. They finally found one. We got priority boarding because of hubby‚Äôs crutches so I dashed to the bathroom as soon as we got on board. It reeked of urine.

1660696363.0,Where to stay on Kauai late October,"We‚Äôre looking at 4 nights in Kauai at the end of October. My first thought was to try to stay on the south coast, but when searching Orbitz for Poipu, I see prices starting at $500/night for hotels, but a ton of condos. Or I can find reasonably priced hotels around Lihue. 

Staying in a condo would actually be convenient if they have a washer and dryer, because our entire vacation is 3 weeks, and this would be in the middle, letting us do laundry one night. But I‚Äôve heard there are issues with licensing of vacation rentals, as well as the ethics involved (though I have a friend who grew up in Hawaii and now that his parents passed away, he and his siblings are renting out their home).  

Given that we‚Äôre not frequent beach goers, is there a significant benefit to staying on the south coast that time of year other than the weather?  Would staying around Lihue be bad?  If we stay at a decent hotel, I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôd have a laundry service.

Background: We're pretty simple, adventurous, and laidback people. We don't do nightlife or alcohol. Ideally the trip would start with a day or two of unwinding, and then be a nice balance of relaxation and adventure.

Dates: Monday May 27th 2024 --- Monday June 10th 2024 (\~2 weeks)

Food: Willing to spend a decent amount, \~$20 per person per meal

Flight: Flying out of California, SFO. Not sure on price but I heard people get some flights for \~$300.

Accommodation: Probably no huge resorts unless it makes sense, don't mind a beautiful hotel or airbnb :D

Activities: Would love to hit most of the major ""must-sees / must-dos""! 

Islands: Maui and Kauai, not sure yet how to split the trip but I think 50/50, about 5 days per island?

Day 2: Check-out from the hotel and take early morning flight to Honolulu. From the airport go towards North shore. Lanikea Beach, shark cove, Waimea bay, food trucks. And then head back to waikiki and check in the hotel. In the night, have dinner and stroll near waikiki beach.

Day 3: Lanakai beach, Makapuu Lighthouse trail, Kualoa ranch

Day 4: Checkout from the hotel, breakfast and take noon flight to Big Island. On the Big Island we are going check-in and simply relax at a resort for the most part.

Day 5: Spend the whole day at the resort.

We have been to both places several times before, but stayed only for a week; this time we have more time but cannot afford to stay at the hotels we know.

Our idea is a little apartment, close to the beach, nice views, maybe a coffeehouse nearby; (Internet access a must since we need to keep in touch with the office) and on a rather quiet neighborhood, the idea is to relax an be able to do most of our shopping, sightseeing within walking distance.

Of course I have visited airbnb and another couple of similar services but to tell the truth I am wary of the nice photos and comments, it is not that I have had bad experiences before with airbnb rentals, but to be honest I am trying to avoid a bad experience by renting a place for 30 days and discovering upon arrival that it is not as quiet, nice, comfortable, clean or anything else as we expected.

So, please I will be most grateful if someone has any recommendations, suggestions or advice in general for us.

Thanks.",VisitingHawaii

We have been to Oahu couple of times, but first time in Kauai. Right  now, this is what we have in mind. Feedback is much appreciated, if its  too rushed or too slow.

I am a golfer but wife is not, so I am trying to golf at least once  on Kauai, maybe twice if we can squeeze it in. I drive but wife don't,  so if I am golfing she will have to stay at one place to relax.

Both of us are foodies, so food will be a big part of our trip. We  are in our late 40's, decent health and fit, so will do some hiking, but  not crazy big hikers in our normal life. I also enjoy fishing, so want  to do deep sea fishing in Kauai and/or Oahu. Really want to catch some  Peacock Bass, but heard those are tough in the winter.

Day 1 - Dec 20: [Fly from](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) HNL to LIH on the 10am [flight](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g29218-Kauai_Hawaii-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html)

following christmas we'll meet her mom and sister on either kauai or maui. we'd love a house rental not too far from the beach and we'd ideally base ourselves there for 5ish days. collectively we love to cook, hike, swim, surf and quiet but not entirely isolated is ideal. curious where we should look for vacation rentals and where people have really loved staying. hard to understand the pros and cons of both islands given they both look stunning.

1. Will we be limited by not renting a vehicle? I was told our hotel is fairly centralized and most things are either walkable or a short Uber ride.
2. We love food and desserts. Any particular recommendations? Things we plan on trying already are: 88 Fresh Fish Market, Giovanni's Shrimp truck, Maguro Brothers Hawaii, Ono Seafood, Marukame Udon, Liliha Bakery, Jolene's Market, and Island Vintage Coffee.
3. We saved the hiking and adventure stuff for Maui since we have more days there, will we be missing much by doing that? Any particular tourist places to visit that is a must do?
4. We also want to visit Costco, 7 Eleven, and some luxury shopping.

For Maui:

1. Not luck on getting a reservation at Mama Fish house for the past month. I was told best bet would be to just arrive waiting at opening to try to get bar seating.
2. We will have a vehicle for Maui to do the Road to Hana. I haven't researched into that trip but was told I could download a GPS guided tour on my phone. Should I plan for a particular hiking trip or will I get enough hiking out of this already?

I'm travelling to Oahu in January for the first time and am super excited. I'm coming in from Vancouver and will likely arrive at noon. I've got a full tour of the island booked for the following day, and the day after I plan to spend hiking around diamond head and minao falls. However, I need to start putting some more ideas together. I will of course visit the north shore for a day and I know there's a shuttle that goes up there that I can book. Then of course there's the museums and pearl harbor etc. Are there any other ideas I should put together that would work well without a vehicle?

I want to preface this post by saying that I understand bugs and cockroaches are a thing in Hawaii. I‚Äôve always heard that even the nicest hotels can have them and they aren‚Äôt necessarily indicative of an infestation or an unclean environment. I‚Äôm well aware they were here before me, will be here long after me and well outnumber me. I‚Äôm also aware that I won‚Äôt DIE if I come across one. That being said, I‚Äôd still like to do my due diligence to reduce my risk of running into any. My main issue is that it takes me a while to get comfortable anywhere I think there may be insects and I find myself tiptoeing around not really enjoying myself, constantly worrying something is going pop out.  

I‚Äôm considering a few strategies and am mainly just looking for feedback to see if anything has worked for others in the past. 

1. No food out in the kitchen at all. Everything in the fridge. 
2. Request second story room. In my mind if I‚Äôm higher up it will be harder for them to get in to my room?
3. Leave lights on in bathrooms at night. 
4. Place a towel across door jambs to try to prevent them from entering. Keep windows closed.
5. I‚Äôm considering purchasing something on Amazon to try to keep them away: either an ultrasonic noise maker or scent bags designed to keep them away, although I‚Äôm not optimistic that these will work that well. 

Again, I‚Äôm aware this is not a life or death situation. I‚Äôm just looking for some feedback to try to make my trip more relaxing. Thanks in advance for helpful responses.

EDIT: I‚Äôm currently on our third day in Hawaii and had a brief run in with a centipede running across the bathroom. I called maintenance to spray and the woman who came was so helpful and gave me tips I wanted to pass on to anyone who finds this post and had the same concerns as me. 
1) she said she had never before seen a centipede on the second floor. So if you‚Äôre bug phobic, request the second floor. Even though it unfortunately didn‚Äôt fully work out for me!
2) centipedes, roaches, spiders, and millipedes will all run away from you. So you really don‚Äôt have to worry about them coming at you. 
3) don‚Äôt let the blankets on your beds touch the ground, because centipedes will use them to climb into the bed. 
4) all bugs tend to favor wet areas, like bathrooms and kitchens. 
5) she told me that most bugs don‚Äôt like light, so it would help to keep lights on in bathrooms. 
6) centipedes bite and their bites are actual super painful, so if you have to kill one, do so with a shoe.",VisitingHawaii

1661398199.0,Help with our itinerary for Maui in November!,"Hi all

My wife and I are taking a week in Maui mid-November since she's never been to Hawaii and I've only seen Kauai (which I absolutely loved, but wanted to see a different island). We're in our early 30s and enjoy beach days but also hiking and similar excursions. We love food, especially seafood and poke, as well as other unique culinary experiences. We're not too into nightlife so we chose Maui over Ohau.  We already have our flight, hotel, and car rental squared away, but are open to a few ideas or recommendations with our trip!

**Th. Day 0 - Arrival at OGG**

8:30pm: Land at OGG, collect rental car (Crusin' Maui) , check into hotel in Kihei. Possible grocery run if they are open by the time our travels and car has been sorted. 

**Fri. Day 1 - Road to Hana**

We'll likely have a little jet lag coming from California, so we figured it would be an opportunistic time to do the Road to Hana as early as possible. I've heard there's a Cafe in Kihei with the best cinnamon rolls, so we may check it out before departing. Do we go clockwise or counterclockwise on the Rd to Hana? I plan on using the Shaka app. Whenever we return, we plan to find some easy dinner, grab some shave ice at Ululani's, head to a beach, and call it a day.

Breakfast: Kihei Cafe or something from home/hotel

Lunch: ???

Dinner: ???, then Ululani's shave ice

**Sat. Day 2 - SUP & Snorkle**

First, we might try checking out the farmer's market in upcountry. We definitely want to do some SUP and a lazy day snorkeling at the beach, and I have a friend who runs a SUP company so we'll try to coordinate something with them. I can't remember where they're located, but we plan to relax at the beach after, preferably at Black Rock.

Breakfast: At home/hotel

Lunch: ???

Dinner: ???

**Sun. Day 3 - Bike Tour**

I've found an E-Bike tour company that I'd like to reserve a couple of bikes so we can do a self-guided tour around Kaanapali and venture out wherever we feel like it. After the tour, we plan on grabbing lunch,  check out Waliea shopping center, and maybe head to Makena beach. 

Breakfast: ???

Lunch: Maui Tacos

Dinner: Monkeypod (rsvp made)

**Mon. Day 4 - Work Day I**

Unfortunately, the only way we made this vacation work was a few WFH days. I'll probably do the West Maui Trail Loop on the E-Bike while my wife works. Early start, early finish. We plan to finish working around 2:00pm and have the rest of the afternoon open. I am leaning towards Hookipa Beach because my friend has seen so many turtles here!

Breakfast: At home/hotel

Lunch: Teddy's Burger in Lahaina

Dinner: ???

**Tue. Day 5 - Wife Bday!!!**

Our fingers are crossed trying to get sunrise tickets to Haleakana. I know it's going to be an early morning, but I've been told this is a must-do adventure! Not sure how the rest of the day will pan out, but it's fairly open. If we don't get tickets, I am considering hikes such as the Waihee Ridge Trail or Waihou Spring Trail. Open to ideas.

Breakfast: ??? (depends on Haleakana)

Lunch: ???

Dinner: Lahaina Grill (rsvp made)

**Wed. Day 6 - Work Day II**

No plans made, but we plan to work from aprx 7/8am - 2/3pm. The rest of the day is open!

Breakfast: ???

Lunch: ???

Dinner: ???

**Th. Day 7 - Mama's Fish and Luau**

This is our last full day on the island, which we'll be celebrating a late honeymoon & anniversary. We have lunch reservations at Mama's Fish house, followed by Old Lahaina Luau in the evening. I know it's a food-heavy day, but these were the only rsvp options available. The rest of the day is completely open to ideas.

Breakfast: ??? (probably something light)

Lunch: Mama's Fish House (11:40am)

Dinner: Old Lahaina Luau (5:00pm)

**Fr. Day 8 - Late Night Flight**

We leave at 11:00pm from OGG, but we'll need to check out at 10:00am from our hotel. I am trying to see if I can schedule a late-check out, but it seems unlikely. At any rate, we travel light and the car will be dropped off at the airport around 7:00pm so we have the whole day to kill. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!

Breakfast: ???

Lunch: ???

Dinner: ???

1662575820.0,Best hotel to stay at near to nightlife in Oahu?,"Just found this sub when researching my October trip to Oahu.

I am a New Englander from New Hampshire. I have always wanted to visit the state of Hawaii mainly from curiosity.

I am not like most people who would go visit the islands for a week or so, I don't mind a one day stay in Hawaii. I mainly enjoy flying, as I am a big aviation nerd who loves to travel and experience flying on different airlines.

I originally was going to Seattle for Five days, but I opted to instead go to Hawaii for a day.

Instead of going to Seattle, the day I was supposed to go to Seattle I instead booked a flight to Kona, HI on Alaska airlines. I will then be in the big island for a day before heading back to Seattle the next day. I connect through Kahului, HI on Hawaiian airlines, where my connection is 7 hours in Kahului, so I may go into Kahului for a bit before heading back and flying on Alaska airlines to Seattle for the next three days.

I have a coworker who is from Hawaii, so they helped me get an idea of what I'll see in the big island of Hawaii.

The place I may be staying at is Naalehu, HI. This place is where my coworker suggested to stay at since they were from there. The drive is 1.5 hours from Kona, and a similar distance to Hilo, HI.

I commute daily 45-1hour to/from work (combined 2 hours driving time), so a drive like this isn't too bothersome to me.

What are some places to see in one day? I plan on visiting the black beach which is just a 15min drive from the town, and then visit the volcano. Those two places are the main places I'd like to visit, but I also would like to go to Honolulu to plane spot at HNL.

How reliable is the Hawaiian Inter-island flights? Is it possible I can still visit the Honolulu airport during my time in Hawaii for a day? If not, what else can I do in the one day I'll be there?

This trip is scheduled for December 2023. I have American Airlines AAdvantage so I was able to use the miles I saved up to go to Hawaii and Seattle!

FYI: it'll be my first time flying on Hawaiian airlines, even though it's Inter-island, I'm excited to fly on their Boeing 717 before they retire those. Same with Alaska airlines!

1690829600.0,Logical locations and itinerary for stay on Maui,"My partner and I are planning to visit Maui in January. Mid-30s ""normal"" couple. We would be there 8 days total counting the travel days to/from the mainland, so we would have 6 full days to do activities.

My partner's hit list of things she would like to do is below, but she also realizes we may not have time to do 100% of this.

My question is essentially, if we were to try to do the bulk of this, would it make sense to stay in different locales for various periods as opposed to say, staying all nights in one part of Maui and driving for several hours on end (which I understand may even be impossible given this itinerary)? If so, what would be the best way to structure the trip? Meaning, start by staying in this area for 2 nights, then move to this area for 2 nights, etc.

Desired activities:

* Road to Hana including visiting a few of the gardens and arboretums
* Hike Pipiwai Trail in south East Maui after Hana
* Snorkeling in one of the south Maui ""Turtle Towns"" and hit a couple of other beaches in south Maui for swimming/relaxing
* Dedicated whale watching tour, which I understand is out of the southern end of west Maui
* Hit a couple of beaches in west Maui for general swimming/relaxing
* Hike Kapalua Coastal Trail in west Maui
* Hike Acid War Zone Trail in west Maui
* Hike Waihe‚Äôe Ridge Trail in west Maui
* Hike to see Iao Valley State Monument in central Maui


Would it make sense to structure the trip like this?:

* Day 1: Arrive in central Maui, head toward west Maui (stay overnight in west Maui)
* Day 2 (first full day of activities): west Maui (stay overnight in west Maui)
* Day 3: west Maui (stay overnight in west Maui)
* Day 4: Road to Hana (stay overnight in Hana)
* Day 5: Hana / south east Maui, head toward south Maui (stay overnight in south Maui)
* Day 6: south Maui (stay overnight in south Maui)
* Day 7 (last full day of activities): south Maui (stay overnight in south Maui)
* Day 8: back to central Maui for airport

Effectively, 3 nights in west Maui, 1 night in Hana, 3 nights in south Maui?

It isn‚Äôt easy to surprise someone in their own hometown, but I was hoping I could take him somewhere he has never been before, even on his own island (Oahu).

I was hoping it might be possible to take him to the Black Point Pool. I know it is on private property, and we wouldn‚Äôt dream of trespassing. Because he is so mindful and respectful, I am sure he has never been there before. If there is any chance someone would be generous enough to loan us the key for the pool and give us permission to visit for an hour or so, I would be so grateful.

My fianc√© and I are headed to Hawaii in four weeks! We're eloping while over there and honeymooning at the same time - safe to say we are very very excited.

We're there for 9 days in total and packing in Kauai and Oahu. We would have stuck to one island, but we fell in love with Kauai's landscapes for our elopement photos. We're from New Zealand so were determined to get photos that didn't look like our own backyard... and the Waimea Canyon ticks that box!

We'd love some feedback on our itinerary. Anything ""must-see"" that we've missed or anything that just doesn't make sense. We're both fit (32F and 33M) but looking for a good balance of relaxing with a cocktail and getting out and exploring. Not keen to have every minute of every day accounted for but don't want to spend half the holiday figuring out what to do either.

Also, we love a tasty meal but we think we would rather wing it and grab food as we go rather than trying to centre our plans around the food.

Would love to hear what you think!

I'm in the early stages of planning a two-week trip to Hawaii for mid-January, specifically looking at Maui and Kauai, and maybe Oahu. My travel partner and I love adventure activities like hiking, snorkeling, and swimming, and we're even considering camping.

However, I've heard that January can be pretty rainy in Hawaii and I'm a bit concerned.

I'd love to hear any tips or advice you all might have for activities that are doable and safe in January.

I'm visiting O'ahu with my partner. We're in our late 20s. Our hotel has a parking fee of $45/night + valet tips, and we hate traffic, so we decided to try this trip without a car (for the most part). Years and years ago, I used to be local in Aiea, and he has also visited before. During our last visit, he actually wished we spent more time in Waikiki and less time scattered all around the island and in traffic. He liked the circus of it all and walking to places. Last time, we did Waimea, Pearl Harbor, Bishop Museum, Kailua Beach, Dole, and Haleiwa Town and don't need to do them again.

I have never been to Electric Beach or Kualoa Ranch. My partner is a big mountain person so I think Kualoa Ranch + driving to the windward side should satisfy that. My personal priority is being in the water.

Down-time is also a priority for me, but is there too much? I have 2 days (5 and 7) where there is nothing planned. I'm wondering if that's too much unplanned time since we can already spend most evenings (and our flight days) chilling out in Waikiki anyway.

**Day 1**

\-Spend the afternoon at the beach right outside hotel

\-Camada Ramen Tavern dinner (walk)

\-OR swim at Waikiki or maybe try surf lessons

This upcoming January, my family and I are planning a trip to Oahu to escape the Alaska winter. This will all be our first time visiting, and seems like Oahu is fit for what we want to explore. We‚Äôll have about 12 people, maybe one or two more. About 4-5 different parties. Cousin and I are the main planners, and we‚Äôre stumped on what to do for lodging. These are the 3 options I‚Äôve come up with.  

1. Everyone book individually at the same hotel. I like this one because it turns into everyone‚Äôs own responsibility, no 5 digit down payment required, and hotels generally feel like a better guarantee than airbnbs. Not to mention the local economy stuff. Costco seems like the best way to go about this, then maybe asking the hotel for being near each other. Is there an option like this, but we rent out condos all near each other? Or is that just Airbnb.   

2. Option 1 but with a multiple Airbnbs. This will give people a kitchenette, in turn saving some money. They also seem a little bit cheaper. I‚Äôm not sure how to distinguish the legal ones from the non. The ones in Waikiki are legal, right?   

3. Renting one huge Airbnb/vrbo and sharing it. This is probably the most cloudy one. Are these big ones legal for a week long stay? I assume this is the most frowned upon one. Gets even more muddy with how to split costs, who makes the big reservation payment, etc.

We are a family of 4, kids ages 12 & 8, coming from NYC for the first time and have decided to drop Oahu from the trip (previously we were going to do 4 islands in 15 nights). Now the thinking is connect straight to Kauai (NYC-HNL-LIH) stay there for 6 nights at 1 Hotel, Hanalei, then go to Big Island for 3 nights and then to Maui for 6 nights before flying back OGG-HNL-NYC 

The thinking is to do the stuff that is most unique to Hawaii (hence Kauai, Big Island, Maui) and put Big Island in the middle so we have a good amount of R&R at the beginning and end of our trip. 

I would appreciate input on -:

1 - Where to stay on Big Island? The nice resorts are near Kona, but then that means a lot of driving to VNP but i suppose even if we stayed near VNP we'd still have to drive there from the airport, I guess just drive both ways on the same day. I am tempted to make BI about just VNP, Mauna Kea and maybe a snorkeling / Manta Ray - since its just 3 nights there and leave the beaches and R&R for Kauai and Maui? But still where to stay? 

2 - Kauai we chose 1 Hotel to have a little less crowds than say Grand Hyatt and to be close to Haena & Napali boat tour. 

*On my shortlist is hike to Hanakapai, Ke'e beach within Haena; Napali boat tour; Kauai humane society shelter dog field trip, Kilauea lighthouse & birds, Waimea Canyon. One of us is prone to motion sickness, so would appreciate people flagging things that might bother.* Is the parking pass for Haena much better than the shuttle? 

3 - Where to stay on Maui, I've ruled out Honua Kai because of the sewage plant smell issue but wondering if that's also an issue for the Westin Kaanapali since its so close to Honua Kai? Presently we are booked at the Fairmont, again we want nice swimmable beaches and minimizing time in the car. 

*On my shortlist is food at Merriman's, Star Noodle, Mama's fish house - catamaran snorkelling tour of molokini, Haleakala sunrise, surflesson.* Anyone done the Haleakala sunrise with kids around the ages mine are? Wondering if they liked it or its one of those dragging them through the Museum sort of things given the early start.

Alternatively, after reading various posts, I'm now wondering if it would be better to just pick one island (learning towards Maui) and spend 10 full days there.

Thoughts? Too rushed? I also want to mention that almost all of the activities we planned on doing were with tour companies that either picked you up at your hotel or at least somewhere close to it. So while it's definitely a busy schedule, we wouldn't doing any driving etc.

It doesn't have to be super quiet as long as our conversation won't be completely muffled by the crowd.

My fiance and I are honeymooning for 2 weeks in Hawaii, with 3 islands (visiting Kauai and Big Island as well). Were hoping to see as much as we can in our 3 days on Maui but also want to be realistic.  Any insights would be appreciated!

Just to note:
- we really enjoy travelling and often take long roadtrips (8-10+ hours in a car) so we're not concerned about all the driving, it's a great way to soak it all in
- we love to relax but also love to explore, so adventure is an important part of our honeymoon


So we're wondering:
- Is the Road to Hana worth a full day? Or is it feasible to plan a half day, by pass traffic and just visit our tops spots (Waianapana, Pipiwai) without regrets for more time? 
- We have Mama's fish house reservations but is it really worth all the hype? Is a Luau, such as Feast at LeLe, or another restaurant equally good? We feel like we have to fit it in since everyone raves about it and how hard it is to get a reso.
- Is Haleakala sunrise that much better than sunset or are they comparable? 
- Is Iao Valley a must see or is it better to spend that time on a beach? 
- Is it better to visit a South or West Maui Beach?
- Any specific beaches that we should prioritize over others (if we only have time for 1 or 2)?


Anything we can skip seeing in Maui and instead just see on one of the other islands (ex: skipping Waianapana and seeing the black sand beach when we get to the big island)? Anything else worth knowing or any tips?

1678041321.0,Itinerary advice please,"My wife and I along with another couple will be traveling to Hawaii for a combined anniversary trip. We are flying in to O‚Äôahu a few days before we board the ship so that we can see a little more of the island.

We arrive early afternoon on Tuesday April 25th and board the ship mid-morning on Friday the 28th. That gives us the evening of the 25th and two full days on O‚Äôahu. Not planning much the 25th because I assume we are going to be pretty tired from flying from the east coast.

There are a couple of must-do‚Äôs for each of so I am trying to put together an activity list that makes everyone happy. Those include Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor, a traditional luau and snorkeling with turtles.

We will probably be staying at the HVV so that may have an impact on what we do.

Here is a rough idea of the itinerary I‚Äôm looking at with questions. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions.

**Tues 25th**  
Arrive, check-in and maybe walk the beach, dinner, etc.

**Wednesday 26th - O'ahu**  
Pearl Harbor. How much of the day should I plan for this? I know there are several sections of the base and I‚Äôm not sure how much of it we will do. I have found a good website with all the instructions on how to plan the visit but I thought I would ask opinions here as well.

Assuming this is not an all day activity would it make sense to do the luau this night?

**Thursday 27th - O'ahu**  
Diamond Head in the morning before it gets warm. If the luau does not happen Wednesday night, that would be the plan for tonight. If we do the luau Wednesday what other things are good to do/see for the rest of the day?

**Friday 28th** \- check out, board ship.

**Saturday 29th - 1st day on Maui.**  
The plan is the Road to Hana. We have an overnight port in Maui so getting back to the ship on time is not a concern. Originally we thought about renting a Jeep and driving it ourselves but the more I read I think we may book a private guide so that we can just relax and enjoy the views. Any thoughts on this? I read a good reviews of a private tour company and they have this date available currently.

**Sunday 30th 2nd day on Maui.**  
Thinking this would be a good time snorkel Turtle Town. Open to any other ideas here and would love to have suggestions.

**Monday 31st - Kona**  
Probably Volcanoes national park but open to ideas and suggestions here. Would likely have to be back to the ship by 5pm or so.

1. Snorkel coral reef - what is a good company to book with and has a great place to see? I saw one company offer a boat ride out, 1.5 hours of snorkeling and a sunset dinner.  Would I want more time for the snorkeling?
2. Swim/snorkel with sharks - pretty much same question as the first :)
3. Deep sea fishing - I did this off the cape of Mass once and it sucked because we went for sea bass and I consistently catch bigger bass around here in the local ponds.

Is it possible to donate extra fish we catch to a food shelter or should we catch and release?

I generally prefer more natural beauty when visiting tropical destinations rather than going where all the tourists are but alas, Maui hotels are way out of my price range.

I had a few questions. I will definitely be renting a car based on what I've read. Does it make sense to stay at one hotel the entire time in O'ahu or should I move around to explore the island more easily? 

Any specific hotel recommendations? I do not need to be at a resort as I plan to explore beaches around the island. I like going out dancing, but I don't need to be within walking distance to nightlife to enjoy my stay. I'm looking to take in beautiful sights, maybe do a few surfing lessons, go snorkeling, and otherwise experience an authentic snapshot of O'ahu (respectfully, of course). 

I will be going solo so more affordable recommendations that are decent, clean, and safe are appreciated. Under $150 a night is preferred but not a hard line. Bonus if there is a decent hotel that doesn't charge a ridiculous resort fee, though that might be asking too much. 

I realize that locals in Hawai'i have mixed feelings about tourists, but if there are any recommendations for sights and activities that aren't tourist traps, that I could experience without being disrespectful, I'd appreciate any input! I don't get to travel much and I really do my best to take in the full scope of what a destination has to offer.

Day 3 : Leaving early, back to the trailhead early/midafternoon and making it back to Lihue airport hitchhiking or with shuttle for flight at 8pm

I'm typically not the fastest hiker but fit in the expected average length of trails

1673201961.0,"Looking for recommendations for Native Hawaiian businesses to support, as well as potential volunteer opportunities","Hello!  My partner and I just received a voucher for two free round trip tickets to Honolulu and two free nights at a hotel there.  We can extend the trip to be up to a week though and book our own stays for the remaining days, which is what we intend to do.  I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôll stay on Oahu to keep costs down and reduce the environmental impact of our trip by not doing extra flights, but I‚Äôm open to maybe going to another island if it would be a better fit for what we‚Äôre looking for.
I‚Äôd like to support native Hawaiian businesses during our stay.  Does anyone know of ones they‚Äôd recommend on Oahu or in Hawaii in general?  If you want recommend places to eat, keep in mind that we‚Äôre both vegan and so would need vegan options.
I‚Äôm also interested in possibly doing some volunteering for a day or two while I‚Äôm there so let me know of any good opportunities for that.

1671070720.0,Help with trip plan,"Hello all.  I need some help to decide how to split our time between the BI and Oahu.  We are taking a family trip, youngest will be 12.  Two families with 7 kids, mostly older teens.  We have 14 days, planning on 9-10 for the BI and the rest on Oahu. We have taken a family trip to Maui/Kauai before with the same group.  We usually spend some mornings on the beach snorkeling, hike somewhere everyday, and then see some sites.  For this trip, we will probably do the same, add in the volcanoes and Pearl Harbor at Oahu.  So, is my time split good?  Or would you make it 7 and 7?  We don't really like super busy areas so that's why I didn't want too much on Oahu but we want to see the island and Pearl Harbor.  On BI, I was thinking to spend some time on the Hilo side for hiking in the park.  Is 2 days good?  Or would you do more?

My worry is I was looking on the north/east shore area and I am wondering about the safety of being on the beach at night. I  considered the west side of the island but drive time is not feasible for us honestly, we both know how tired we will be. I thought Moloa'a Beach might be a good option? Or Larsen's if there are lights at Moloa'a? Or Haena SP, we will be hiking to Hanakapi'ai Falls the morning we plan on going but are going to leave to explore some other beaches and get dinner.
